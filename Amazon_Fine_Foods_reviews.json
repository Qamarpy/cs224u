{"sentence":{"0":"The murders in Juarez are real. This movie is a badly acted fantasy of revenge and holy intercession.  If there is a good movie about Juarez, I don't know what it is, but it is not this one.","1":"Mexican men are macho rapists, gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats. Mexican women are semi-pagan, pious fools. There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy, culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter.  The story is absurd, the characters are unbelievable, the stereotypes are offensive.","2":"While this maybe an entertainig movie for the ones who have not read the book, it is an abomination for those of us who cherish one of the world's greatest classics.  It is like Romeo and Juliette getting married and live happily ever after.  There are indeed beautiful scenes, good acting and an appealing story the movie is not really reflecting the book.  I was thoroughly disgusted walking out of the theater. I would very highly recommend the 1974 version with Richard Chaimberlain as a much better film","3":"Unfortunately I have read the 1400 page novel and seen the movie versions starring robert donat and gerard depardieu.  hence this version is a trivial adventure flick, with nothing at all of the magic of the classic.  this might serve as an entertaining movie to a modern viewer with no idea what the real novel has to offer.  this is less faithful, hence less sophisticated, even than the classic comic book version.","4":"This was only useable elsewhere. It said wrong area when I inserted it, But Im told it cant be returned if 'opened' I just took off the cellophane. Why agree to sell and post a DVD to the UK when it was impossible to watch?? a big con trick","5":"It finally arrived after waiting over a month....it was sent with no protective wrapping of any kind and was damaged...as was the case it arrived in...I was very disatisfied and not pleased...from now on I will only order strictly from amazon.","6":"This review is not of the movie, which I love and why I want it on bluray, the review is of the actual bluray disc.  I bought the movie and exchanged it twice all for the same problems: on my Sony bluray player after the Touchtone splash screen it would shut down the player.  On my PS3 it played fine but only has 2.1 PCM 48Hz audio, no Dolby 5.1 HD.  My player and PS3 have recent updates.  Hopefully you will get a good disc to enjoy the movie to its fullest.","7":"I can't belive they dis such a horrible work on this movie, if they would have stuck to the plot that went on in THE BOOK, you know, where they got the idea from, then the movie would have been a success.  But since hollywood likes to ruin great works of art, then they do what they did with this movie, they BLEW IT!!!! If you really want to get the true feel of The Count Of Monte Cristo,  then READ THE BOOK, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED THERE.","8":"This is a very good movie but, the only thing it has in common with the book is the movie has some of the characters.  There, that's it.  The movie could have been named anything but, not \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"  If you really want the whole story, read the book.  It's a great book.  A good movie but, it has nothing to do with the book.","9":"The cast was good as was the the movie in general were it not for the fact that the story was so different from the actual book.  It was a real dissappointment to say the least.","10":"After finishing Dumas' classic novel, I immediatly watched this movie. About an hour later, and a hillarious balloon scene, I sadly ejected the DVD, which I now use for a coaster. If you've never read the book, you've got nothing to lose. But if you've ever read the book, you get that sense of annoyance very quickly, and outrage towards the end. Do yourself a favor and read the book first! It is excellent!","11":"I understand such a huge book can not be transferred wholly to the big screen, but the script deviates drastically from the book in the way it ends. Had i known that, i wouldn't have bought it.  There are some very nice scenes & cinematography.","12":"I've never read the book so I cant compare, but I do remember that the film itself was quite boring at times and just too long, or at least it felt long. Normally I love movies like this, but this just didn't do it for me. The acting was OK, nothing special stuck out out for me. The set pieces and costumes were very well done however, which I think is essential in a movie such as this. Other than that, I would skip it.","13":"This DVD would not play due to parameters.  Read carefully ...REGION 2.  Will not play in America.  Total Fail for me!<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000063W1R\">The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2<\/a>]","14":"Well this is a great movie but have not had the pleasure of getting to watch it because I am out of region. What does that mean anyway!? Not sure but don't buy anything if out of a region cause it won't play. Guess ya live and learn!","15":"I opened this \"new\" DVD and it skipped every 20 to 30 seconds throughout the entire movie. I would not recommend buying a DVD from this seller, as it may not work properly.","16":"For those of you who have read the book (abridged or unabridged), be prepared to be dissapointed!  The only similarity that the movie and the book share is the name itself.  It is a travesty that somebody can re-write a classic literary work into something like a made-for-tv movie!  Check that...there is a made-for-tv series in French (made by Bravo, I believe) that is the closest depiction of The Count of Monte Cristo that I have ever seen.  I would not waste my time watching thismovie!  See the bravo flick...not this one!","17":"What an unmitigated piece of garbage.  Richard Harris is always wonderful but he's the only redeeming feature of this perverse twisting of Dumas' classic.  See the G&eacute;rard Depardieu mini-series instead.  (If you can ignore the fact that he doesn't look starved in the Chateau d'If, it's wonderful.)  Except for Harris the acting is poor.  The people are unrealistic and are, at best, caricatures of Dumas' creations.  The writer has committed a crime.","18":"I have a blu-ray player that is a year old.  The firmware is from this year. This is the first blu-ray disc that will not play.  I tried two copies that were in perfect condition.  Do not buy this disk.","19":"This movie is the events of Dumas' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure\/love story.  The formula is the same used in 80's montage movies:  1) Weak but good-hearted kid suffers as he hands of evil men.  2) Kid has a montage.  3)  Kid gets revenge.","20":"I had to return this Blue Ray twice and I still don't have a working copy. finaly I told Amazon to refund my purchase. the disc would not play on my new Sony BR player. I updated my firmware and other BR discs played on my player, but I was never able to get this disc to play.","21":"I've been itching to buy this movie since I saw it in the theatre. Now I'm going to have to wait until they release a widescreen version because there's no way I'm paying for pan&scan.<p>A beautifully crafted film both in visuals and acting, not to mention the masterful story telling. The only letdown is not having widescreen, which is unforgivable and therefore this DVD release gets one star, for what would otherwise be a five star rating.","22":"My only reason for seeing this film is because  Luis Guzman is in it.  I find these Napoleon\/Shakespeare\/pirate films to very very dull, boring and over-long.    Luis plays a much different role here than what we are use to seeing.  Doesn't he look handsome in that red English coat?","23":"The DVD was from the wrong region - didn't even know that was possible. So irritated I didn't want to mess with return process.Still don't have my DVD,  ) :","24":"The least informative documentary I have ever seen and I am a career student.  This documentary provided no proof for its claims. All of the claims are backed by indivdual opinions with no creditability. Dont waste your money... Email me and I will mail you my copy.","25":"The actor playing Van Gogh has the mannerisms and speech patterns of Woody Allen. It's the worst acting I've ever seen, and there's nothing else to focus on, as the film is nothing but a series of hallucinated conversations interrupted by stuttering, hand-wringing monologues.","26":"\"One Body Too Many\" (1944) is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast. The \"B\" programmer remains notable for Bela Lugosi's delightful presence as a coffee-serving butler - the funniest of his red-herring roles. In fact, Bela garners more laughs than Haley's cut-rate version of Bob Hope.","27":"the stream was pixelated and kept on stopping and starting. There was no smooth stream. I tried to watch it at different times on 2 different computers same results","28":"The quality of the DVD was disappointing.  It stopped many time through out the movie, we finally gave up and sent it back (we did play another DVD to make sure that was not our machine's problem).","29":"Set out wanting to like this but found it over long and very focus on Mr Cruise. Do we really need so many lingering shots of his greatness and the fairly ponderous lines. The film outline is OK and there is a stroy but unless you know nothing of Japan and it's history, some of this film is fairly dull and slow.","30":"A samurai is an Asian\/ Japanese knight. It was a decent action\/ adventure flick. Worth renting once or twice. Tom Cruise's fame doesn't do much to heighten the film  sceptic's disbelief. I think how good the actors and director can suspend your disbelief that what you are seeing is staged and not real is how to judge a good movie.","31":"basically a rip off of \"dances with wolves,\" but done poorly.  very empty when portraying japanese history and culture especially since this issue should have been central and not taken a backseat to tom cruise weilding a sword.  <p>on a plus side, its well shot and good visuals.  watanabe steals the show, but even he is not enough to save this shallow movie.  typical blockbuster movie with no depth. <p>if you are in the mood for an \"independence day type blockbuster action movie\" see this.  otherwise, dont waste the time.","32":"i have last samurai HD DVD and BLU-ray..the HD has a poor sound but the BLU-ray has a great sound...the picture quality is the same for Blu-ray and HD DVD and there`s no much diffrent from regular DVD","33":"The scenery and set are the best part of the movie, as are the Japanese actors and actresses. The plot is entertaining. Then Tom Cruise comes in and plays, . . . Tom Cruise.  He is a looser ex-military drunk who ends up in Japan and teaches this ancient warrior class how to fight.  Cruise' ego once again is center screen, the pretty boy who can't act ruins another good movie.","34":"Decent acting, decent actors, terrible writting, no research into Japanese customs whatsoever, almost as insulting as &quot;Rising Sun.&quot;  Waste of over two hours.","35":"Wonderful movie, one of the best you'll ever experience and since most reviewers wrote a lot about this movie I won't.  The DVD was very disappointing to me because this movie was based on Japan and it's history, however, it doesn't offer you to watch the movie in Japanese or it doesn't even offer the Japanese subtitle!!!  They offer the typical, Spanish and French!  It would have improved this DVD greatly if they had an option to either watch it in Japanese or to watch it with Japanese subtitle.","36":"In terms of history, thie movie is a fiction, but it succeed in explaining the main idea of samurai spirit. I like it.","37":"Three faults of the The Last Samurai (2003):  1. Tom Cruise  2. The actor who plays the emperor  3. The script (esp. the last scene -- horrendous)  Three merits:  1. Katsumoto  2. The beginning of the first battle scene  3. Some nice landscape shots (had to pull this one out of a hat)  On balance, it is obviously a bad movie.","38":"yawn.....  anything happen?  no?  ok yawn....","39":"I knew what sort of film to expect when I pressed play but this film I thought was quite poor, a huge let down. Anyone familiar with Japanese history would I think feel \"is it necessary to make up a fictional character from scratch to give an account of when the samurai became obsolete as a class when \"real\" characters from history could be deployed?\". If hollywood wanted to make a film about how the samurai mode of fighting was becoming outmoded then they could have used characters like Isami Kondou instead of Katsumoto.","40":"I hate this film very much.  One of the worst movie I have ever seen.  The last battle field is totally ridiculous; yes, R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S.  All the samurai are killed (in such a way) except Tom Cruise (still alive)?!?!?!  How many people can survive such an attack (heavy open fire) if this was real?  I was amazed to see Tom Cruise walking into the Emperor Meiji's chamber and proudly presented himself as the last samurai the end of the film.  What the heck?  This film should be -3,000,000,000,000,000 stars!  Grrrrrrr!!!","41":"Yes I thought this movie was alright when I first saw it and I kept thinking that the story was vaguely familiar and then it hit me replace the samurai with Indians and Tom Cruise with Mel Gibson and you've basically got dances with wolves. this movie is a rip off and completely unoriginal.","42":"The movie was well made with action, action, and then more action. I couldn't really find a plot or figure out just exactly who the good guys were until nearly the end of the movie. Teenagers will love it. Adults will probably get bored, like I did","43":"I was disappointed in this sequel, tho the special effects and most action was terrific. The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me. The ending was predictable early on, and was a clone of \"I Robot.\" The film's monotone coloration was depressing, and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls (huh?) and skeletal teeth (they eat hot dogs?) The attempt to weave in Arnold S. at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick (Terminator 2)felt disjointed and like an afterthot. Save your money.","44":"I thought Salvation was decent, and I was definitely considering purchasing it when it arrives on DVD...well, not anymore. The DVD version is only coming with the theatrical cut while the Blu-ray is coming with that AND the director's cut. Why? DVD is far from being a dead format. I know the studios and such are trying to promote Blu-ray and whatnot, but there are plenty of other ways to do this. Until the director's cut is available on DVD, no purchase from me.","45":"Can someone tell me what this movie was about? The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor. There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED. One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T \"be back\" if this is the best they can do!!","46":"Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut.  Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage.  DVD is still the top selling format.  Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.","47":"What's going on?  Why should I care about these characters?  Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends.  Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space.","48":"Earth is destroyed except for a few people and the machines.  John Connor gives Resistance radio pep-talks with all the inspiration of an annual tax form.  Death-row guy discovers that Skynet made him an infiltration Terminator and he screams, \"Noooooo!\"  Lots of fighting.  Stuff blows up.  Machines buzz.  Connor always escapes as the lone survivor of man-machine slaughtering while death-row infiltration Terminator keeps on fighting to save the day.  Neither man nor machine is deserving of victory and there's no prize for the winner.  It's just two hours of stuff grinding together.","49":"The Bottom Line:  Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.  2\/4","50":"I have really liked the the first three movies, even the goofy third. This one was difficult to follow. The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects. However, the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting. It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese, they weren't. Not really. Then, we have the end. I felt it was straining for some deep moral\/ethical statement, but just struck me as empty, loose and amateurish. I think it's really time to Terminate this series :)","51":"The digital copy included in the set expired in April 2010.  I just purchased it for the holidays.  I would not have purchased this set if I had known.  Now that it's open it can't be returned.","52":"I agree with everyone else here.  I call this an EPIC fail!  The sad part is, I own a PS3 and STILL won't buy this in protest!  I find it very offensive that only Blu Ray customers get the Director's Cut.","53":"This is the worst terminator movie. How anyone can like it is beyond me 1-3 were good this one was utter crap.","54":"This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins. Confusing and disjointed, frequently frustratingly illogical, it comes out boring, even with all the well-done CGI mayhem. Said mayhem is non-stop, becoming a mindless blur of disjointed human and robot body parts flying nowhere.  After the first two in the series, this one is even more of a disappointment, fans should see  this as a continuation of T3; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name. At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $9.99. Small consolation.","55":"I kept waiting for the movie to get going with suspense but it never did.  What a waste of time and money.","56":"If all you care about in a movie is one action sequence after another, hardly any dialog, zero character development, and no story.... this is defiantly the movie for you. This movie makes T3 look like a classic and the TV show Emmy worthy.","57":"This is not acceptable. Why am I not in this movie. You cannot self terminate, but you will all be terminated.","58":"the trailer for T:salvation was perhaps one of the better trailers I'd seen in  along time. Despite the fact that McG was directing, my expectations were high. But man was the movie disappointing. Sure the special effects were great, which is a credit to the animators and the budget for FX, but everything else was just terrible. The story was WEAK, the acting mediocre, the editing choppy and all the fun of the previous terminator movies was completely missing. It was an overserious bore.","59":"Totally unorginal film!  Don't bother with this tripe, I would write more but is impossible to make this movie any worse than it is!!!!!","60":"I can't review this transaction because I never got the movie.  I thought that maybe things were backlogged around Christmas, but it's February...and still no movie.","61":"- The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.  - There's no suspense in this movie. Terminator 2 is suspenseful from the beginning till the end.  - There are a lot of actions but they're not engaging as those of Terminator 2 either.  - It was supposed to be touching at the end when someone scarified to give his heart to another person but I was not moved. I don't know it's because of bad directing or acting. It might be both.","62":"Get the Terminator Salvation (Two-Disc Director's Cut + Digital Copy) rated R from Amazon.ca  (Amazon Canada)  Product Details Actors: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin Directors: McG Format: NTSC, Color Language: English Number of discs: 2 Studio: Warner Home Video DVD Release Date: Dec 1 2009 Run Time: 118 minutes Average Customer Review: No customer reviews yet.

Beware custumers from brazil, there's no portuguese subtitles on this blu-ray.","64":"Hello people, I suggest not buying this movie until the DVD is similar to the Blu-ray!","65":"Simply horrible.  The acting, dialogue, directing.  Even the CGI wasn't that good.  Steaming Pile of....","66":"I found myself watching the movie and some thing felt amiss it was an action packed movie but something just was alittle off. McG just doesnt get it right I loved the fist 3 movies yea even #3 I loved the sarah connor chronicles but this movie just wasnt terminator I walked away feeling very dissapointed","67":"This is by far the worst Terminator Movie ever.None of the action of previous movies.No major fight scenes like in the first movie between the robots and humans Lots of talking and no action.If you liked the action in the 3rd one (a lot of people obviously did not by what I have been reading for other reviews) then stay away from this one. I never fall asleep in movies but I begged for a pillow.lOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKED THIS ONE BUT ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE I got your back!!!!!","68":"T4 isn't as good as the 1st.  I had a movie ticket to use, & Paramount wasn't showing Star Trek that night. It was OK.  I rate it Z4, as in ZZZZ.","69":"I ordered this movie about 10 days before Christmas as a Christmas present and it never arrived.  I'm still waiting for some kind of word, even from Amazon.  Still nothing even after contacting twice via email. I'm surprised Amazon even lets this kind company on their web site. Isn't collecting money under false pretenses illegal?  Thanks Amazon.","70":"I won't add any spoilers here for those of you who don't know how the movie ends. I liked the movie... until the end. What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me. Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that.","71":"For me this was the least liked Terminator movie,, I even liked 3 better. It was a bit corney and watching Cristian Bale is hard to do after hearing his screaming rant temper tantrum he had while making the movie, its just hard to like or support an actor that is such a jerk in real life. Cheers Davyo","72":"This film was atrociously bad.  I wouldn't watch it again if it was running free on network TV, much less buy a copy of it.  It was pathetic in all aspects...","73":"Bought this movie as a Christmas present at a great price.  Saving on each present means more presents for the folks on my list.  Thank you Amazon for helping me out.","74":"Terminator movies should have stopped after the amazing T2 movie directed by James Cameron. Terminator Salvation is by far the worst Terminator movie out of all 4. It really makes T3 look like a masterpeice, eventhough I did not likt Terminator 3 that much. Christian Bale does not fit as John Connor at all. I can't believe from what I heared that he will be in 2 more Terminator Films. LET THE TERMINATOR MOVIES GO TO REST. IT IS LOSING ITS PLACE IN THE GREAT SCI FI MOVIE LIST.","75":"I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much.  Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.  Peter J. Miller","76":"This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this \"HD\" blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv. Even broadcast looks better on my TV...Story was mediocre, and special effects were OK ...would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise.","77":"I had actually watched his forgot about it, rented it realized I had watched it and thought very little at it. Basically the series lost all momentum, in this movie.","78":"I WAS EXPECTING A DETAIL STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION BUT INSTEAD I GOT THE DIRECTOR OF THIS VIDEO TALKING AND TALKING IN THE SCREEN FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE VIDEO","79":"I read the review where someone said this movie is full frame, so I referenced this movie on dvdplanet.com. Sure enough, it says it's full frame!!  Unforgiveable !! I think this is 1 of the best movies ever. Who is the bird brained gremmie responsible for sabotaging this dvd ?  Grrrrrrr.  I was going to buy this dvd, but now I will just record from my ES II laserdisc onto a dvd.","80":"it only had a hint or a flavor of the book. I actually read the book which is really good if you like freaking yourself out. The movie was nothing like it. The movie was just one of those weird 80s things","81":"This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck!","82":"I don't own any of these, although they are all great flicks.  Unfortunately, this collection isn't a great deal compared to buying them  individually. It doesn't offer any substance beyond the individual DVDs,  only the convenience of buying them all at once. <p>My suggestion would be  to mix and match your own Arnie favorites rather than buying this  collection. This collection leaves out the Terminator series, the Conans,  Raw Deal, et al.","83":"HYPOTHERMIA is one of those \"creature features\" that would have been more successful had the film gone more humorous or campy.  Unfortunately, the film takes itself way too seriously including a creature that is an actor in a silly looking scuba diver's suit! Venerable character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker give adequate performances in cliche-driven roles and there is a certain eeriness in the snowy landscapes.  Blood and gore are utilized but tame compared to current standards.  At only 73 minutes, HYPOTHERMIA passes quickly, so it might work as a double bill on Halloween!","84":"I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks' The Mahabharata on DVD, and today it arrived.  How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS.  I have not watched this version yet, but I cannot believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc.  So a warning to everyone:  if you want the full miniseries, THIS IS NOT IT!","85":"This is a disappointing, sliced and diced version of the long epic shown on public television many years ago.  The cuts change the storyline and make it difficult to follow, especially in reference to the amazing 5+ hour original.  Buyer beware!  This is not the original, full length version.","86":"Dammit - I wish I had read the reviews more carefully - this is so badly abridged that if you don't know the story already it is very difficult to follow. I have wasted my money on this, and will now have to buy the full version.","87":"Warning to Moms of young children.  I let my 4 year watch this movie.  She adores it and I did not think I had anything to worry about with it until she started saying \"I Hate My Life\".  When I asked her where she learned to say that and she said from the Barbie movie.  Sure enough, that's what Barbie says in it.  I am shocked phrases like this were in a Barbie movie and I am very disappointed","88":"My biggest complaint with this Barbie movie is the line from Barbies guy friend expressing excitement at walking in on a \"girl hug\". Do we really need that kind of suggestive remark in a Barbie movie aimed at girls ages 5 to 12?","89":"The animation is jerky, Barbie looks odd and nothing like herself.  She's portrayed as a highschool student, but acts like a middelschool student.  Poorly written, poorly animated. My 8 year old daughter loves Barbie movies, and she asked me if we could send this one back.","90":"story line: not for young kids, and not even really good for older kids. she has to try to fit in with the cool kids. whatever. i hate that an animated kid movie took on the teenage ideals of teenage movies. (!!!!!)  animation: sucks. was expecting every other barbie movie animation. those look amazing, this was verrrrrry poor.","91":"This movie is just a waste of money and the story is so juvenile that it might as well be rated NC-17 for how much skin can we show and not be rated XXX. Don't waste your money, especially if you have young children at home.","92":"I bought this because of the good reviews, only to throw it in the trash after the first 5 minutes. I was expecting a great western but got nudity and female mutilation in the first 5 minutes. The trash is where it went and where it belongs. What a disappointment.","93":"I anticipated a great movie because Robert Duvall is in it. After seeing Open Range I was ready for another great western.  I was really enjoying the movie until it just up and ended after the girls were being rescued again. There they are fleeing town and the credits start rolling. Talk about being ripped.","94":"Sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west.  Sure there were some noble men and victimized young Chinese girls, but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie.  I do not find very graphic violence, nudity, and rape on the top of my must watch list.  I skipped to the ending on the second disk.","95":"Thought I would try an anime to see what I missing out on, wow was this horrible. I think I and everybody else should sample the best of a medium. I get that this isn't in that number, but again wow. The mentality of someone that could enjoy this boggles my mind. I'll try Ninja Scroll and if the story development is as offensive I'm checking out. This makes X-Men 3 seem reasonable.","96":"I have no review of the version because I couldn't get past the fact that there is no Japanese audio. With all the things that can be done with DVDs today, it doesn't make any since that this one comes with 1 audio choice. Even for region 1 there isn't even a French audio selection. This seems like a shoddy product. A friend of mine even returned his copy because there is no Japanese selection.","97":"It is disappointing to find that this DVD doesn't have Japanese dialogue setting.  English voice actors for Anime are [bad].  I always hear similar voice like Goku(Dragon Ball)from all the animes, or either they all scream in the scene.  Can't they afford much better voice actors?","98":"very good movie - 4 stars! but this us edition only contains the english dub!!! (and got very poor picture quality...)","99":"The best performance in the film was Kyle McLachlan's Ray Manzarek, even though his part was small. Val Kilmer lacks charisma in his portrayal of the late charismatic singer Jim Morrison. How can a man who is perpetually stoned and wrapped up in his own little world be interesting or charismatic? I found Kilmer's Morrison unlikeable and unwatchable. The Stone\/Kilmer Morrison has no redeeming qualities - casually and carelessly hurting everyone in his path with his selfish, hedonistic lifestyle. I actually fast-forwarded through quite a bit of this film because every scene was just \"more of the same\".","100":"The video resolution is very poor, I in fact have to watch the DVD in \"zoomed\" mode in order for it to make it fit the screen.","101":"The movie is interesting and I think Val Kilmer did a good job.  I rate this so low because Artisan  just put big black bars on top and bottom and then calls it widescreen.  This is FAKE widescreen and is a bad, bad, bad thing.","102":"be serious: Val Kimler playing Jim Morrison?  Oh, be real.  Oliver must've been WAY stoned.  But instead of being so negative, here's an idea:  how 'bout a \"two CD-set\" of...um...say, \"Helter Skelter\" with Pee Wee Herman portraying Charles Manson?  And then you could drag out J Lo to play Squeaky Fromme, and keep the \"reality\" in high gear, eh?","103":"Oliver Stone, a great director in general, really slacks off in this one! I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but, Meg Ryan as Pam...only in a dream world.All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded.  Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story  along. All in all a very good story but, not nearly an accurate depiction  of Jims' rise and fall","104":"Oliver Stone's portrayal of the Doors and Jim Morrison is extreme and in many cases untrue and exaggerated.  He takes the events of the Doors and binds them into cliche rock band problems that never happened.  The UCLA  film by Jim Morrison was never that extreme, and there were a lot more  inaccuracies in the movie.  If you want a true account of the Doors, read  Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek.","105":"Oliver Stone's and we all know about him, rendition of a quasi biography of an influential 1960's rock band. We are treated to behind the scene understanding of what makes Jim Morrison, Jim Morrison.  The movie dragged on and on and on with psychedelic filler. Most of the actors were sleepwalking through the script, especially Meg Ryan and Val Kilmer.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00006L929\">Doors - Soundstage Performances<\/a>","106":"The older surviving brother of a wagon train ambush, seeks revenge on the leader of the gang responsible for the murder of his parents and the kidnapping of his younger brother. Years later, he is the leader of a group  of 'vigilantes' who oppose lawlessness and unknowingly confronts his  'long-loss-brother' who has since learned the tricks-of-the-trade from the  outlaws.","107":"My 9yr old popped the DVD right in when it arrived. She's heard all my stories about how much I felt I'd learned with the help of Schoolhouse Rock. We watched and sang together. I think she got a kick out of it. Some of my favorites were totally left out! The 9's and 7's - 6's... were not in there. I assumed that since it was an anniversary editions that they wouldn't leave anything out. I was disappointed by that.","108":"I was disappointed in the quality of the product. The CD keeps freezing during certain points.","109":"Schoolhouse Rock! is supposed to be complete on DVD but Disney has pulled another fast one. They have left out one of the four \"Scooter Computer & Mr. Chips\" videos. Shame on them! I urge everyone to contact Disney and demand a remastering!","110":"The dvd was listed in used but good condition.  What arrived was a case that was completely broken down the spine.  The cover was scarred and sticky, like a three year old had attacked it with a jelly doughnut!  The dvd itself has scratches, but none so significant that it hasn't played the tracks that I need.  This was purchased because I teach American History.  I don't have time to go through every track.  When I get to them I'll find out if they work. Bottom line....never again from this seller","111":"This product does not seem to keep school age children enthralled in the learning process, even though that is what the intent was.  If your child is older than 7, I doubt they will like this.","112":"DVD arrived in a timely manner; however once I inserted the DVD in it would not play.  The DVD made a lot of strange sounds but never showed a picture nor gave a clear sound.  Dissapointed:-(","113":"I was really looking forward to sharing my favorite memories of Schoolhouse Rock with my two daughters, ages 6 and 4. However, the DVDs I received were marred by encoding problems from the manufacturer. I attempted to replace the disc 2x but was unable to find a copy that could play successfully in DVD  player.","114":"These disks will not play on a Mac.  At all.  Since my macs are my only DVD players, this makes the set no better than coasters.","115":"I couldn't get this program to work; I concluded that it is incompatible with Windows XP.","116":"I don't know who the people are on this interview, even though they are labeled as \"entertainer\". The Narrator sounds like he is reading a book report that half of it is filler. The few times we see Katy Perry speaking was taken from random TV interviews or was taken from vlogs. Somebody was looking to make a quick buck with a DVD with Katy Perry on the cover.","117":"This dvd went from the dvd packaging into my dvd player and then directly into the trash (cradle to the grave scenario)...this product should never have been released because it's of zero quality (btw, who the heck are the three twits being interviewed, they seem to have zero relevance to the artist whatsoever)...I took a chance on this knowing it's an unauthorized release, and I got burned big time! Buyer beware, this thing stinks!","118":"Very poor quality copy - so dark it is impossible to tell what color the horse is.  We live in Carbondale, where this was shot, so ordered it for our cowboy-loving grandson.  What a disappointment!","119":"Not enough close ups to see how fingering should be. Never shows you how to line up the footer with the rest of the flute. She is much too  nervous.<p>Ernie O","120":"La novela no esta entera comienza adelantada y Los capitulos ban cortados no se le entiende no la compren no gasten su dinero","121":"Rubi is severly cut in all duration of the movie. Why do they do this? Want to buy some more telenovelas but am warry. Perhaps when I see a review that people who bought them said NO MORE CUTS! Then will I start buying them again. Sorry. It just makes me so mad!!!","122":"I normally don't write reviews regarding movies. I think people should see a flick and decide it's value for themselves. However, I think the movie &quot;Manhunter&quot; is an outstanding movie. Five stars. Buy it! DON'T BUY the Director's Cut. The entire second disk is fuzzy \/ out of focus. It's really annoying and a waste of your money. The extra included material is not worth the extra money it will cost you!","123":"So much of the integral parts of the book Red Dragon were completely ignored in this movie rip off, that it is a bitter disappointment.  You don't even see or hear the name Francis Dollarhyde until he kidnaps the  reporter!  There is not nearly enough investment into Dollarhydes psyche,  let alone his motives. The characters that Thomas Harris so vividly brought  to life in his book are shallow replicas in this movie.  If you loved the  book Red Dragon, do yourself a favor and skip this movie.","124":"The Human Stain has a dream cast, but each star is shockingly miscast.  Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman lead the list of Oops, I shouldn't be here, but are closely followed by Gary Sinise and Ed Harris.  So mujch talent, so sadly wasted.  i actually felt embarassed for Hopkins.  Better luck next  time!","125":"With all the great actors in this film who are absolutely the top, I expected the film to be excellent. To me, it is a film that does not know where it is going. It heads off in too many directions. I was thoroughly disappointed. Maybe I should have read the book first, but Mr. Roth is not a favorite author, he writes as if dialog for textbooks, and soon becomes boring and hard to concentrate on the story.","126":"\"The Human Stain\" was recommended to me by a friend from Atlanta Georgia. When I was scanning amazon's web for dvds, I was so happy to see that they had this dvd. When I inserted the dvd in my player, I received a message saying please eject, not for this area. I was so dissappointed,and trying to get credit is like trying to pass a congressional act. I will never order anything through amazon.com again and have advised all my family and friends of my experience.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0001XAPX8\">The Human Stain<\/a>","127":"not only too much material  trying to cover but wrong casting.  Love mr. Hopkins but get real.the back and forth,flash backs  made it seem that the film was more like patchwork.  Sort of left unfinished  just seemed not quite able to pull it together.","128":"Ive seen bad films, but this one takes the cake,,, unfunny, amateurish, boring and stupid actors.  Looks like they wanted to make a bad movie like they used to make  in the 50's....and failed.  Shot in black and white with the gore and cheap sex scence in color.  Even if they were shot in 3d it would not save the film.  Please give me real moviemakers and send these low grade crappy actors\/directors into the sunset....  This film makes the Toxic Avenger series look good.......","129":"This is one of my favorite, don't worry about the content, movies.  I was totally disappointed with the DVD version.  The picture quality was simply awful.  Contrary to what was advertised, the DVD was a cheaply reproduced copy.  I was so disgusted that I trashed the DVD and now look forward to watching Red Dawn on late night televison.  Purchase this movie only from a highly rated vendor.","130":"I can't believe that anyone ever took this film seriously.  I give it two stars simply because it really defines and illustrates the paranoia and &quot;red scare&quot; mentality of the Reagan era.","131":"This movie was moronic.  The Red Army is no match for a small group of dim witted teenagers?!?  Gimme a break!  This movie was chock full of utter nonsense.  It was not believable nor did it suspend my disbelief which is the fundamental rule in movie making.  Instead it called attention to itself at every turn with conspicuous exposition, horrid acting, and bad dialogue.  A screwball from the past like this will normally have some comedic value but this one did not.  I give it 1.5 stars.","132":"This movie is about a battle that took place, from what I can gather, sometime between Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War I. It is about Cuban insurgents that infiltrate a strategic town somewhere in the Rocky mountains. The Soviet Union joins the Cubans to fortify the town which is seemingly unreachable by the American military due to it's logistics. A few fresh faced kids battle the insurgency but ultimately fail in the end. This movie seemed to glorify the actual event which gets little if any mention in historical texts.","133":"This one deserves a place of honor among Great Bad Films. The acting is absolutely wooden, the plot  implausible,  production values and action sequences cheap, all of it bathed in a heady mix of hoary right-wing paranoia and american apple-pie mythology.  If you're a tea-partier you'll probably love it. The rest of us, it might do for drunken late-night amusement.","134":"Communist troops land in middle america and begin machine-gunning children.  A Russian soldier disarms a corpse and the camera pans to a bumper sticker &quot;They will take my gun away when they pry it from my cold dead hand&quot;.  Get the idea.  This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.","135":"OK, so there are these Russians, and they attack the U.S. by parachuting into the interior of the country, whereupon they commence blasting everyone and everything in sight.  Kids in a small mountain town high school are shocked to see camo chutes decending lazily through the morning sky, and then the brutal execution of - oh, pretty much anyone standing around.  I suppose if you're a brain-dead redneck, you might find the story intriguing.  Otherwise, you're in for two hours of \"Oh brother!\"","136":"No word on earth would describe the stupidity of this movie in a sufficient manner.","137":"Just like Farenheit 9\/11 is a despicable, demagogic movie of the left, so too is Red Dawn on the right.  I will say one good thing about this movie, in contrast to the ultra-boring Farenheit 9\/11:  the story of how six meat-eating, gun-toting, Ronald Reagan-supporting high school kids camp out in the Rockies and eventually save America from the Ruskies is hilariously entertaining, no matter how stupid.  It's no stretch to say this is Patrick Swayze's finest role ever.","138":"The video started out great with Mr. Segovia playing a couple of peices but quickly degraded to just scenes of the Spanish country-side with only the music being played in the background.<p>If I was interested in seeing  Spain, I would have bought a video to that end.<p>I wish I could return  this tape but unfortunately you cannot return opened video  packages!!!<p>Extremely disappointed, expected more playing and less  scenery.","139":"This definitely was not what my kids and I were expecting - christmas you would think would mean christmas episodes but not so much","140":"This movie is just a waste of money and the story is so juvenile that it might as well be rated NC-17 for how much skin can we show and not be rated XXX. Don't waste your money, especially if you have young children at home.","141":"The acting was bad, the story could have worked if the movie wasn't filled with stupid fillers like one of the characters waiting around for a pay check, another character sitting around in a closet and making a big deal about a narcoleptic janitor.  Much of the movie was filled with stretched out dead moments.  Really, never recorded Tupac lyrics on a roll of toilet paper sitting on a shelf in an office, come on.","142":"Not worth the money.  No plot.  Just some nonsense. Don't waste your time or money.","143":"rent it. If u must see it. I should have kept on walking. Loved the actors but this movie just gave them a little paycheck. I couldn't finish this movie at all. I tried then I said why?","144":"I'm on the second disk now, and the third episode does not play on my xbox 360, on my TV's DVD player it skips constantly, however, it does play on my PS3. Not really sure why, it is not the blue ray version so there is really no excuse for the dvd to only play on certain devices.","145":"What a disappointment! Writers block supreme! they resurrected every villain, acquaintance, and relative of Clarks. They made him face and defeat every one he ever fought and then killed them off again. So many flashbacks the viewer often lost sight of what was actually going on.  More alternate dimensions, got sent back to the phantom zone, the Luthers, on again off again weddings, and any other trite cliche you can think of. Barely watchable and certainly not worth the price.","146":"This final season I place in the worst season in the ten year history of the series. If I had seen this series on television I would not have purchased the box set.","147":"While I like the new computer generated animation, I'm disappointed that the story was much more intense than most Thomas adventures.  The scene where Diesel almost falls off a bridge had my 3-year-old son in tears.  That's not at all what I expect when I pop in a Thomas movie.  Parents be warned.","148":"This DVD stopped right in the middle, which was very upsetting to a 4 year old.  It would not forward to restart a little later or anything.  It was done.  I bought him another and threw this one out.  This was my the only disappointing experience we've ever had with an Amazon order.","149":"I really hope the people in charge of making Thomas read these reviews.  My 3 yr old fell in love with this show over a year ago.  Even he prefers the old model \"live action\" version.  The computerized crap has lost the magic it used to have.  BRING BACK THE OLD THOMAS!!!","150":"Unless you have a \"Gamer\" computer you will be disappointed.  This game is a RAM sucker and a clocking hog.  Frankly, I don't know who would allow their kids to play on a top off the line box  The chapter play has no continuity. It plays like a an old bad movie full of flashbacks and dream sequences so that you never know which way is which.","151":"The price and service were exemplary. However the series has no fluidity or any real direction. There are some naughty parts in the first disc of the series. But then they didn't know which way to take it. They just kept making them anyway","152":"I remember my pre teen years watching this show. Loved it. This is VERY MISLEADING INDEED! I should have read ALL of the customer reviews before buying. It's not a complete series. It's the last seven episodes. I wasted good money to get Screwed over. Lesson Learned. Luckily I purchased used so it wasn't a complete loss. Even if you wanna go search for the OVA 1 and 2 of Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki, don't. Tenchi Universe is much better and funnier. Go that route instead.","153":"Silly annoying over-the-top acting!...Comedy that's all to predictable being the same as most comedy Bollywood movies, following the same formula of comedy but this time just way to silly. Katrenia does her usual same wooden acting as in all her other films - look sexy, smile, dance - That's it!  If it wasn't for the soundtrack this film would have got 0! Stupid plots, predictable characters, silly unfunny jokes, no acting skills. Avoid!","154":"I am a generous critic. I like almost like something about a movie and review it generously.  This movie is ridiculous. I enjoy the soundtrack. You should just keep listening it it.  Acting is in one word: nonexistent. Its not funny. Its just dumb. Its not even silly.  Its just a painful journey to watch this entire thing.","155":"Just pathetic!...Way over the top comedy that just becomes stupid, added with annoying over-the-top acting. Katrina Kaif again does the same wooden acting as she does in ever other film she appears in. No substance, silly story, predictable acting esp by Katrina Kaif - Avoid!...Only thing decent is the soundtrack.","156":"I like Bollys. A LOT! I purchase and see many of them. Music and humor is light as air and an excellent palate cleasner, after the usual \"there been a murder\" \"let's blow something up\" type of films that currently pass for cinema. Kiiing is just plain out of the way I need to barf stuff. Horrible, terrible, rotten, no good and also a stinkeroo. Almost as bad as Marigold. Another alleged fun flic where I hated EVERYONE in it, regardless of their roles.","157":"Has a low budget feel.  like ET but special effects are sub par for a Spielberg production.  No surprises.  Just ok.","158":"It's like an odd mashup of Jurassic Park, Stand By Me, District 9... And many other movies I've seen before. I'm really surprised because I typically like the people involved. At least I didn't pay to see this in the theaters! That's why I love cheap rentals on Amazon!","159":"I had heard that the reviews for this movie were good and so I decided to give this one a try.  The cast were excellent at the start of this movie.  The action scenes were the best I have watched in a very long time.  It kept my interest until near the end of the movie and it simply fell flat very quickly - the ending made me angry and felt the J J Abrams has finally lost it - not his best at all.","160":"This movie started off good, it was really interesting and engaging for at least the first half or more! Then it started to show a very typical pattern of predictability and although the actors did a good job the story I lost interest with and I was not a fan of the ending.  Some may like it, I watched because it had good reviews but I was not impressed and can now say I've seen it but will probably never watch it again.","161":"The performance by the actors is great; there are moments that are quite touching.  But the story plot, ET type, is not clearly laid out, and sometimes quite inconsistent.  I would say if you want to watch the movie for effects--OK, for story--not really.","162":"Guess I was expecting a real sci fi movie but this seemed more like a kids growing up dealing with issues type movie ... with a great train wreck scene thrown in.  Bleh ...","163":"I found th e mini movie at th e end to b e th e more entertaining of th e two","164":"I'm not sure why this movie received such amazing reviews.  The story was okay, but the pacing and acting made it difficult to watch.  My husband fell asleep about 30 minutes into it, and he wasn't even tired.  I'm not sure what the price is now, but I would recommend waiting until it hits $.99 or free before I would recommend renting it.  Then again, I often suggest that everyone watch the blockbusters, if for no other reason than to improve future Trivial Pursuit games.","165":"Five of us, of various ages, watched this move together.  We all had five thumbs down.  After reading some of the glowing rewiews here on Amazon, I do wonder if they mean anything or are written by the production marketing detartment.  This movie was quite lame; poorly written and the acting was uneven.  We gave up counting the gaps in the plot, such as it was.  Here we have a massive train wreck; yet the colonel walks right up and picks up the film wrapper. I could go on, but why . . .","166":"The title of my review is my actual review. I don't think this utterly dull POS merits any more effort being expended.","167":"they took ideas from 80's classics and tried to bring it to life but it had as much life as the zombie movie they were trying to make matter of fact the zombie movie was better Hollywood garbage wastee of money one word for this picture LAME","168":"it was a decent movie, part goonies, part ET but those movies are classics and this one is not.  i watched the whole thing but i am sure glad i didn't waste any money on it.","169":"The \"Goonies\", \"Stand By Me's\", and \"ET's\" of my day were way better. Super 8 tries to be a coming of age story, but falls way short. Like so many movies today, instead of developing the characters and focusing on a good storyline the film relies heavily on special effects. In doing so the film loses its heart. We have plenty of Transformer type movies, it would have been nice to see this movie differentiate itself. Also, what happened to the professor in the end....?","170":"A dud! The \"monsters\"...the whole movie... was too vague. Not worth buying, but okay for a rental if you're really bored.","171":"The movie has no real plot, and the characters are not believable at all.  The 'alien' is kept in shadows at all times like used to happen in the really old sci-fi movies where it was done due to how hard it was to make the alien believable.  Attempts to communicate with the alien are just absurd, and lead to an anti-climatic ending.  This is like a modern version of those really, really bad sci-fi B-movies of the 50's and 60's.","172":"\"Super 8\" is essentially \"ET\" on steroids, but while it's produced by Steven Spielberg it lacks the emotional force of a Spielberg movie.  The characters aren't really likeable or credible, making their many attempts at creating emotion uncomfortable to watch.  Despite Abrams' reputation for spinning a good yarn, there isn't much of a story here.  All in all, this is a very bad ET re-make, and everyone would be better off re-watching the original.","173":"I was unable to fully enjoy this film due to the insanely loud sound fx mix and low dialogue mix. I had to ride the remote volume the whole time.","174":"Lame movie. Kids will probably like it though. Waste of money. Good thing it was a Red Box so i don't feel as ripped.","175":"the movie was slow to action & 90% of the movie was too dark so you really cant see whats happening. wasup with that? then it was almost predictable but boring...please dont waist $10 like i did. kids even lost interest and fell asleep lol","176":"Most of the action was in the dark, which is usually meant to mask really bad special effects. I found myself bored fifteen minutes into the film, advancing it, with hopes of improvement, better acting, effects, something, but it never came. If you have really nothing better to do, don't watch this movie still, just sit and stare at the wall, it's brighter and more entertaining.","177":"Why go w\/ a bad guy mil. , this is not the 90's. Film could of at least tried for something original.","178":"Preposterous plot. Characters with no depth. Bad SFX. Gawd awful. No worth the time I spent watching it. Save your money.","179":"Insipid sentimentality with production values and a big soppy musical score. And a derivative plot, utterly predictable. Has the worst aspects of King and Spielberg.","180":"This movie was not advertised as such, but was really a teen movie.  I felt like I was watching a Disney horror flick.  It had some scary parts, but it was clearly geared towards teens, so was a disappointment overall.","181":"This movie was a complete waste of my time and money.  I went to watch it in the theaters and when it ends you are like, \"really, that's all it was\".  Complete waste of time.  Don't watch.","182":"You will know what is going on long before this movie \"reveals\" it. I got bored and distracted 1\/3 of the way through. I am very sorry I bought it. Rent this one if you have to, but don't expect too much. The acting is good, as are the effects, but it never, ever, astonished me. It was more like waiting around for it to finally end.","183":"This movie falls flat on its face trying to be the \"ET\" of today's generation. A predictable plot, tired character roles, and a boring take on \"other life\" are all throw into a blender and comes out a muddy, soupy mess in the end. There is no satisfaction to be had watching this film if you are over the age of 12. If you are 11 and younger - enjoy!","184":"The movie had all the childhood charm of most typical Stephen king movies but the actual plot was a little far fetched and lacked a good story. Not one of his best performances by far but worth watching at least once in life. Any more than that I wouldn't reccomend.","185":"great preview..lousy movie. It really did seem like a bunch of kids made this movie. Just really bad plot & bad acting.","186":"Derivitive. Predetor, Aliens, ET, Close Encounters , War of the Worlds+Cloverleaf etc. all rolled into on unmemorable mess.  Follows the usual Spielbergesque formula...monsters+drippy sentimentalism+smart a.ss kids+comic relief druggie dude.","187":"They focus way to much on making us try to care about the characters, and fail. First 20 minutes of the movie could be deleted. The movie is 80% about some kids making a movie and the romantic connection between two of the kids. When E.T. goes home in the end, we're supposed to care and be happy for it. Fail. Very slow moving movie.","188":"This Movie in my View is a B flick.  They might have put a lot of money into CGI to make it work but the plot really didn't work all that well.  If you see a ton of movies this might be a good one to see once but be smart and rent it and not buy the movie.  Thanks Robert","189":"the movie was shot in such dark scenes that you could not see half of the movie. Most of the movie is soo unbelievable that its annoying. Don't bother. Heck I dont think I will watch any more movies from with JJ Abrams of Speilberg.","190":"i don't understand what do Spielberg with this film try to copy ET or GOONIES?? how an ALIEN make a ship with garbage! and why wait 40 years to do that! or simply this movie is a precuel of CLOVERFIELD is the clone????? better movie of monster is THE TROLL HUNTER","191":"After the first ten minutes of the movie, I was ready for a nonstop sci-fi thrill ride. I was extremely disappointed. The rest of the movie is completely disjointed and has no idea what it should be. Way to many plot lines and none are fully resolved.  And just out of curiosity, why would the AIR FORCE put the world's most valuable military secret on an unguarded train; traveling through the middle of the country?","192":"I usually like work from JJ Abrams (Star Trek, LOST), but this movie was REALLY disappointing.  My husband and I rented thinking, oh the reviews are good so let's give it a try.  The plot, the characters, the beginning, the middle, the ending --- all of it was extremely boring.  I would've stopped watching it after first 15 minutes, but I figured I'd see what the good ratings were about.  One of the worst I've rented this year.","193":"I wander who's the target audience for this flick. The pickup ramming and destroying a million ton train. ET running around killing killing everybody. Looks more like a spielburg movie than JJ Abrams.","194":"This was one of the worse movie ever made, it was another Cloverfield. We lost interest after 15 minutes, the previews made it look good, but it wasn't. The kids did great, they have a future in acting. Rent it if you don't believe me but don't waste your money buying it, it is a watch once movie.","195":"This is another very lame and cliche film about aliens.  The story was incredibly predictable and was pretty weak.  I felt cheated after watching.","196":"This film kind of lost me at the train wreck...I've seen a train hit a truck, in fact a box truck not a pickup.  The train just swatted the truck aside (destroying it in the process) and continued on, with out derailing a single car. This crash was as though the train had hit an immovable wall, propelling huge freight cars through the air as though they were weightless, at least until they hit the ground. Speilberg does love his CGI....but it doesn't make a movie.","197":"I so wanted to like this. I mean with names like Speilberg and JJ Abrams, I thought this would be great. I'm a huge \"Fringe\" fan, but this movie lacked any of that vitality. The kids were okay, but the plot line was weak, the acting poor and it never seemed to work, for me anyway.  For being blu-ray, and having a few action scenes, particularly the train accident, it could have been so much more intense.  Sadly, all this taught me is this: I will be more cautious of future movies with these names attached.","198":"This was so bad! We walked out of it. It tries to capture that whole Spielburgesque feeling, you know, with kids on the bikes in a suburb looking for adventure, but fails completely. What plays out is extremely tedious. It's nothing more than a B monster movie with every character a boring stereotype.","199":"Another movie where the government is the bad guy. The monster, which kills people and hangs them upside down, however, is just misunderstood. Plus, the plot is a badly disjointed patchwork of ideas stolen from \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"  \"E. T.\" , \"Jaws\" and Stephen King's \"Tommyknockers.\". Save your money.","200":"Very Boring movie.  Really did not like it. It was good at first then it just went sour after about 20 minutes.  Hated It!","201":"Save Your $3.99.  There is a reason that there is a Facebook page called \"Super 8 Is The Worst Movie Ever.  I rented this thinking it was a Steven King movie.  Instead I got Stand By Me, Meets ET and District 9.  Totally predictable and uninteresting.","202":"Who let Spielberg get away with highway robbery? Who turned their heads & allowed this guy 2 steal this kind of $$$ 4 this garbage?! No 1 was watchin' the cookie jar when he put his hand in & emptied it! This movie should have gone str8 2 the dumpster right out the camera! The kids did a good job with what they had 2 work with. Who ever created this mess should be flogged! Horrendous story! Good job kids! Not worth the harddrive it was saved on! I rate this a -5!!!","203":"This movie was awful. To have it be compared to E.T. and other great movies like that was ridiculous. I couldn't wait for the movie to end and then the ending was even worse then the actual movie.","204":"Not sure what movie many people were watching based on the reviews praising the film but I found the story line just to be ok and the ending to be really dumb. It felt like the film was trying to hit me over the head with some subtle political message (like Avatar).","205":"AWFUL!!!!  JJ Abrams needs to do better research if he wants to do Sci-Fi. The kid stops the alien from eating him by telling the creature, \"I understand\". What are you kidding?","206":"The audio track on the Blu-Ray is corrupt making it completely useless. The DVD works, but if I wanted to buy a DVD, I would have bought it as a DVD for less money. I heard of others having the same problem.","207":"This movie had so much potential!  There really could have been a real story, some depth.  There is not climax to this film and there's really just a surface story.  [SPOILERS]  They mention when the alien touches you, you understand it.  Yet they don't elaborate on this point.  They're just like 'here it is, we're not going to do anything with it.'  It could have been a great movie. I was so disappointed.","208":"this pathetic excuse for a movie took my money, wasted my time, my energy.  i can't believe Spielberg produced this utter ridiculous joke.  if you are 5 years old, then go see the movie, if you have a brain at all and an adult, please stay away as this garbage will suck the life out of and drain you dry.  really bad B movie is a good rating for this cheese wiz.","209":"Certainly not a family movie.  The story was completely boring and I could not wait till it was over.  There was a ton of needless cursing, especially by the children, and an F bomb, for what reason I have no idea other than more Hollywood brain washing to promote the cause that cursing is acceptable.  Thank goodness I rented it for free with a promotion through Redbox!","210":"This is pure garbage. The plot is ridiculous, and the dialog is really banal and laughable. After the train crash, which is very impressive, this movie takes a downturn to the level of a B movie turd. I wish I could get my money back, but at least I did not buy this stinkbomb!","211":"I tried to cancel my order before I watched it but I guess you can't do that. From the reviews that I read, I wasted money on a movie that I didn't see. Seems to be a good movie for children from what I read.","212":"Steven Spielberg has lost his touch for a long time now.  This is a terrible film.  The actors (kids) were very good.  This is one of those films that rarely shows you anything and use darkness to hide things instead of spending the money to show you.  I absolutely think this is one of the worst films of the year.  Please do not buy this.","213":"I CAN'T REVIEW THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO BUY COMBO PACKS.WHEN IT COMES OUT ON BLU-RAY BY IT SELF I MIGHT BUY IT.","214":"ET? Goonies? Wake Up! Are Classics, this is poor trash. What Happend with the real tributes? 1\/2 - Star in my concept.","215":"Are you kiddin me, what a waste of a perfect bluray. Do not purchase. Warning,warning cannot believe Spielberg put his name on this bust.","216":"This movie had great potential but really fell short. If I had gone to the movie theater to see this movie I would have been terribly disappointed.","217":"This is the same old four public domain titles that pop up everwhere.  They also appear on the SONY Three Stooges DVDs, restored form 35mm.  If you want cheap, you'll get what you pay for here. If you want quality buy the SONY DVDs.","218":"The 3 movies were such bad quality, they were difficult to watch. Bright Eyes was so bad the entire film \"jiggled\". They had the look of pirated films.","219":"Star Classics version of THE SEVERED ARM is unfortunately the Cut TV Version and not the UNCUT and UNCENSORED Version offered by the defunct VIDEO GEMS.","220":"lots of low-quality stuff that has been circling around for years, also lots of ripping-off of other companies without paying them. Overall: hands off of this if you value these movies.","221":"This is not the DVD version of Speak of the Devil. Speak of the Devil was an incredible live album of ALL BLACK SABBATH songs performed by this band. I can't believe I'm the first person to point this out.","222":"i have had many bootlegs of this over the past 25 or more years and most of them are better quality than this, i dont know if this is official or not but its not worth your money, i gave it 2 stars for the audio alone video is crap!","223":"Hey look, the songs are great but when I had the DVD, the sound or at least the 5.1 sucked. Only for serious collectors.","224":"I bought this brand new and every single disk in the set had huge gashes and scratches. It will not play half of the episodes because of the damage. This item was still wrapped when I got it so this damage happened in the factory. Not happy and I couldn't get my money back or return it....","225":"this is going to seem a biased Review to some , and perhaps rightfully so  but I base it on the assumption that \"quality\" and \"Literal translation\" must be considered synonomous  The Subtitle on this show is a polite nod as they dont even include the option of changing the credits so you dont see the case closed logo (Maybe that was a neccessity of Including so many episodes for so low a price but I wish I'd known...)  I'd rather own the Original  and practice my jappanese with it personally  Down with Dubbing.","226":"Jimmy Stewart playing a harmonica? Maybe in l941 America had its mind on the war and movies, like this one, were very loosely put together. Paulette Goddard plays her usual kinda dingy part. It is interesting to see Horace  Heidt's band again. A young Art Carney is spotted in this not-so-unusual  plot of struggling musicians, love on the fly, rushing here and there to  make the auditions and play dates. You wonder how hunger these actors were  to play in this movie or was it made on furlough for the folks at home.","227":"Jimmy Stewart playing a harmonica?

You wonder how hunger these actors were  to play in this movie or was it made on furlough for the folks at home.","228":"This DVD produced by (shudder) Madacy offers a very good Laurel and Hardy film (&quot;Flying Deuces&quot;) with a very, very poor one (&quot;Utopia&quot;, AKA &quot;Atoll K&quot;). Bad picture quality (with compression) is evident on both films, along with wafer thin sound. The extras are typical of Madacy. There's a trivia game, filmography, and some biographies. All in all, you should stay away from this to find a better transfer of 'Flying Deuces.'","229":"The DVD is very close to the bible for a small part,especially Jesus' miracle signs that jesus didn't also like. I'm not a pharisee. There is no idea and messange of jesus.","230":"Not as good as I Love Lucy these four episodes of her later show don't do Lucy justice. Another thing is the quality. DVD's are supposed to be of high quality but they used a very bad film copy when they made this. It  even jumps in a couple places! I'm taking mine back to the store.","231":"I found these movies to be extremely formulaic.  The plot wasn't all that bad though and seemed to at least move.  The most disappointing factor of all is that it's on DVD and the sound is terrible.  You can't understand  half of what they say.  It sounds like they recorded off of a bad speaker  that keeps popping.  At one point the film even scrolls.  Disappointing use  of media, okay plot, excellent for camp value.","232":"Did not care for this movie at all! Boring and worthless plot! Wish I could get my time and money back!","233":"Not that I expected a documentary, but playing John Nash's delusions straight for the bulk of the film and then jumping out and yelling \"Surprise!\" reminded me a bit of the Ewings trying to pick up their lives after Bobby died, in \"Dallas,\" and then having him show up in the shower the following season because Pam was dreaming for all of last season. It was a cheap trick.<p>This film exploited Nash's schizophrenic hallucinations at the expense of the very real handicaps he had to overcome, and I didn't appreciate it one bit.","234":"In the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' we are supposed to understand and sympathize with John Nash as he battles schizophrenia.  But what astounds me about this movie is that it never explains schizophrenia.  Most people still think it's that MULTIPLE PERSONALITY URBAN MYTH.  They might think the imaginary roommate is personality #2.  I must also add that I read the book and the movie and book are extremely different.  The movie is the HOLLYWOOD VERSION.  Most of the stuff in the movie is fictional.","235":"I should have walked out of this movie 30 minutes into the show. I am amazed at the level of \"cookie-cutter\" sentimentality and plot ploys that were contrived to produce this movie. The dialogue was so lame I found myself audibly snorting in disbelief. And what about Jennifer Connelly? Was that acting? Rusell Crowe did a two-star job under horrible, flat directing. A Beautiful Mind insults all of our original and good instincts. What a piece of garbage!!","236":"I heard that this was a great movie, so I decided to rent it.  I was very disappointed with the movie.  Most of the time, I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't.  I definitely would not recomment this movie to anyone.","237":"I never liked this guy. He was never interesting. I thought he was less intelegent than his peers. As for the Movie...... I love Ron Howard but this one was a Dead film....  I watched it again:  This movie was alot better the second time. I guess you have to hate the main charicter to like him. I changed my star ratting from a 2 star to a 4.","238":"This was probably the most confusing (& boring) movie I've tried to watch in a long time.  The critics gave it such rave reviews that I should have known it would be a real snore!","239":"I absolutely, 150% HATED this movie!...  After getting so many great reviews and winning 4 Oscars, I was excited to see this movie.  What a disappointment it turned out to be! The acting wasn't terrible on the actors and actresses part, but the whole plot was horrific! I can't believe this movie got such great reviews! ... It's such a shame such an amazing and inspiring story was put to pieces.","240":"this movie confused the hell out of me, probably because i read the book (excellent).  unfortunately terribly inaccurate and unnecessarily sentimental fluff in hollywood = garner awards and praise  that blonde in the bar scene is just awful and a completely incorrect notion of a nash equilibrium.","241":"I couldn't relate to or appreciate this movie.  Actors seem unworldly and certainly like no one I ever knew.","242":"If you want to see a movie about the JOhn Lennon killing, get Chapter 27 with Jared Leto. It's much better. I have both this one and Chapter 27.","243":"I never had the fortune or misfortune to watch this movie because it won't play and I can't contact the seller.","244":"Some of the tracks were bad. I wanted to send it back to you for a replacement, but I had been very busy. Is there a possibility that I can get a better one?","245":"Was not the movie I wanted my misstake  but it came on time and was packaged as it should be thoe I have not watched it so I have no opinion on this movie. silly me.    Barb","246":"this movie is the worst movie in the 07 set and i would not buy this movie maybe rent it if you just have to see it","247":"I can handle a B-movie horror flick, own 100's of them. this is the absolute worst of the series!","248":"I bought this almost a year ago at Wal-mart because the front cover says: \"A Zombie film that breaks the mold.\" It started off okay, then you find out that the epidemic is spread through rats. So, when people become zombies, they also look like rat people. So, yeah, don't watch nor buy it!  I would not recommend MULBERRY STREET!!!","249":"This was another waste of $14+.  The acting was fair, but the story was weak and disjointed.  This is yet another in a long line of failures in the \"AfterDark Horrorfest.\"  If you absolutely MUST watch this DVD, rent it.  Don't buy it.  Really.  It's not worth keeping.","250":"This Movie Was Awful!Its like a remake of the graveyard shift. I was not scared one bit total BS! Do not buy this unless Rats scare you.","251":"the other reviewers gave away the story so these people did see the movie, ratings are unbelievable. system wont allow zero stars. this is pure garbage. slowly builds to the most stupid zombie type plot. 28 days-ish but for a kindergarten film class.","252":"Seems like this plot has been re-written a million times.  Great movie to show for a troubled school when a teacher doesn't show up.","253":"Stay far away from this movie.  Looks like it was shot for 50 cents.  Boring, hard to get past first 10 minutes!","254":"this movie was terrible.  i want my 1.30 back.  the writing is just ridiculous, unbelievable on all accounts. no wonder it grossed 30 dollars.  how anyone could give this movie 5 stars is beyond me.","255":"I watched this movie and it's crapy,crapy and you will never get the 1 hour and 25 mins.back from your life so please don't buy it if anything rent it like I did and save money and for me its not good at all....","256":"The worst movie I ever experienced. Lousy on all counts.. Hated it! I would not recommend and so disappointing even the ending was hokey. My husband fell asleep. Wish I had not ordered this one, when there are much better acting and movies that have real content. The ending even sucked, although could not wait for it to be over.","257":"No knocks on the two movies-- they're both worth seeing.  The issue here is the product itself. This MADACY gray box series is of the lowest possible quality. Their SLP dubs track poorly and have degraded video of unrestored public domain stock.  Truth is, at that snail's pace speed they could've fit three or four films on a single VHS instead of issuing this double dose space-waster.  Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape: try to locate studio releases or at very least labels that you are certain record at the SP mode.","258":"Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio. Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality  legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out  Charlie Chaplin DVD's). This is a shame because younger folks who've never  seen these classics may walk away with the wrong impression. If you really  want these titles get this one, it looks cheaper than ASIN B00000IC8F  (which has the same titles &amp; release dates).  But Caveat Emptor folks.","259":"Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash.

All in all, you should stay away from this to find a better transfer of 'Flying Deuces.'","264":"This is why I'd never heard of this movie before, even though I'm sort of a movie buff.  It pretty much sucks.  The first part is slow and boring, a few slasher scenes notwithstanding.  Michael Biehn turns in a poor performance, and neither the killer nor his kiddie apprentice are believable at all.  There's just too little evil in the killer.  The rest of the film is mostly predictable and like the setup, really needed some good editing (and acting, and scripting, and everything).","265":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I make it a point of watching low budget b movies.  I expected a bad movie, lousy dialogue, bad acting.  But this was just an excuse to show the torture of young women.  A good horror movie, does a little more than just show degradation.  No suspense, no tense moments.  Obvious ending.  I can't believe I wasted time watching this drivel.","266":"I wanted to like this, because I love a good scare, I love blood and gore and I love violence in movies. Not all of the time, but some of the time. I mean, how can you be scared without violence and blood and gore. Well, you can be. Alfred Hitchcock could do it.  But this movie I couldn't watch. Once you start bringing the horror to children like they do here, I turn off. Women too, the scenes weren't necessary. I'll say it again, I couldn't watch this.","267":"I was not sure what to expect from  this film, but even without high expectations, I found myself disappointed.  This struck me as nothing more or less than a run-of-the-mill slasher film, purporting to explain the development into a young serial killer of an innocent 5 year-old boy who is abducted from his back yard.  I found the film unremarkable in every dimension - writing, production values, acting.","268":"Ineffective storyline plods along from scene to scene of gratuitous torture and murder. A crazy guy's occassional delusions passes for character development. As in many films of this nature there are very attractive women, cast as victims, and they do dumb things that put them in absurdly dangerous situations. In one scene a victim's foot flail's uselessly around the perp's head begging more than the obvious question of why doesn't she kick him in that peanut head-- rather how did the actress AVOID kicking the guy in the head.  I did not like the movie.","269":"SICK ! DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE. SICKEST OF THE SICKEST. FRED KRUEGER SEEMS LIKE A DISNEY CARTOON COMPARED TO THIS SENSELESS BLOODSHED. ONLY A SICK MIND CAN CREAT SUCH A HORROR. THE DEVIL MUST LOVE THIS MOVIE SINCE ONLY EVIL PREVAILS IN IT.","270":"Horror is one thing and I love horror movies.  But gore for its own sake is not even scary....it's simply sickening. There are no words awful enough to describe this nasty, evil, senseless, bloody piece of gore!!!!!!  What a sorry excuse for horror.  And shame on the parents who let their children act in this movie!!!!!! I only give it one star because there is no choice to give it zero stars which is what it deserves!!!!!!!","271":"This item I bought was scratchy in the middle of the film. The disk never finished a specific scene and jumped-skipped to another scene. I never received the first copy I ordered though said it was shipped, so a kind woman from Amazon.com sent me another w\/o charge or shipping.","272":"I usually enjoy Tyler Perry movies.  This one was just over the top melodrama with no  laughs.  The characters jumping to (wrong)  conclusions and the vindictive, uncontrolled reactions wore thin.  Stick with the first movie.","273":"Just finished watching it and I was so disappointed.  Too much negative drama. I expected it to have more funny moments and less over the top drama.  The ending was SO DISAPPOINTING!","274":"Feeble attempt to rip off the first movie. Do not waste your time or money unless you like watching mean-spirited, bitter films.","275":"I am all for an all black cast, but don't undermine my intelligence by trying feed me crap.  The comedy was non existent, and the drama was horrible.  TP is good, but he missed the boat on this one!  I saw it at the $3 dollar theater 2 weeks after it's release, and even at $3, I think I spent too much!  All my girlfriends who saw it agree.  TP tried to do wayyyyyy to much on this film!","276":"This movie seemed rushed and so unlike Tyler Perry.  It is truly my least favorite of all of his movies.  I almost walked out of the theater...to me, it was just that bad and there is NO comparing this movie to \"Why Did I Get Married\". There was no need for a sequel if it was going to be so terrible.","277":"I really loved the 1st movie \"why did I get married anyway\"?  This one was not up to par for me. I usually like all Tyler Perry's movies, but didn't particularly care for this one. I didn't even like the ending.","278":"Way too sad and depressing.  Not entertaining at all.  Can't believe that this movie has been rated as 4 stars.  The first one was much better.  Hopefully this is the end of the \"Why did I get married\" films.","279":"The plot was totally unrealistic.  What a waste of time.  TP, please don't make a third edition.  A lot of beautiful black people but there was no real character development.  Would not recommend this film.","280":"Sorry to say I have no idea how this movie is since it is restricted to DVD area 1 and we live in area 2. Pitty beceause we would have loved to see what we paid for.","281":"only played to chapter 4 and Amazon had to refund me.. booohohoooo. will not buy from them again. did not even respond to my email","282":"The cinematographer John Bailey (American Gigolo, The Big Chill and as good as it gets) was speaking at the LA film school in 2003 and showed clips from the Conformist. I immediately asked him about it. He said that there's a new print at Paramount made by Vitterio Storaro. I have written Paramount and Criterion. Please harass Paramount about it. It's a shame that such a classic and influential has been ignored for so long.","283":"FOR 35 YEARS I HAVE CONSISTENTLY RANKED THIS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.  HAVING SAID THIS, THE VOICES USED TO REPLACE THE ITALIAN AND SPARE THE SUBTITLES STRIP THIS FILM OF ITS BEAUTY RESULTING IN A JUXTAPOSE REMINISCENT OF \"WHAT'S UP TIGERLILY?\" OR A REVERSAL OF THE PLOTLINE IN \"SINGING IN THE RAIN\".  GREAT FOR A COMEDY, BUT I DOUBT IT WAS INTENDED BY THE PRODUCERS OF THIS IMMENSE FILM.","284":"Why the release of this outstanding film to DVD has been so long delayed has been mysterious. Previously the only version available in the USA was an overdubbed VHS. Not that Bertolucci used actors who were all speaking Italian in the scenes, the sound was added post, but it is great that this version has the option of Italian and French. However, this movie is really meant to be seen in original Black and White and this copy is TECHNICOLOR. Wierd. I was wondering why so cheep. Kind of dissappointing for one of my favorite movies of all time.","285":"I must have watched a different film than the below reviewers.  I couldn't even get to the end it seemed so disconnected.  When you have to read the jacket cover to figure out what is going on...something is really wrong.  Maybe you have to be a professor to understand this movie but I found it worthless.","286":"DVD only works first 5 minutes, movie scratched. Movie continues to not work even after out threw cleaning machine. Waste of money!","287":"Seen the first, 2nd would probably be just as boring. They are rated 2 to 3 stars that isn't much and really i didn't find this briliant so the 2nd would get boring too. It is a little bit like scream, but scream is much better. Because the set is stupid on this like at the begginning, she sees the murderer and he sits laughing and it looks a little bit silly. Scream is more serious than this it is more freaky for people and scream is way better.","288":"The idea of Scary Movie seemed great,but the results aren't so great.Entertaining to say the least,up the story line follows Scream to closely for most of the movie.Some of the humor is funny,but I don't really care to see women with male body parts or male parts in someones ear.","289":"I found this movie to be rather disturbing in its portrait of people in general.  The careless actions of the actors in this movie are some of the contributing factors to the labels that not only African Americans are trying to break free from, but teenagers in general suffer from these sterotypes also.  It is a shame when a movie as sensless as this one was is at the top of society's list of favorites. If this is what people find entertaining then we need to stop complaining the problems in America because we are our own worst enemy!","290":"Scary Movie (Keenen Ivory Wayans, 1999)<p><p>The tagline to this movie promised &quot;no sequel.&quot; Would that it had been accurate. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this (but then, come to think of it, I had no pateince for mindlessness when I was a teen, either), but I found Scary Movie about as funny as American Pie-- a whole lot of jokes that missed the mark, and those few that found it just didn't appeal to my sense of humor. Besides, why parody a genre of films that's already so mired in self-parody? (zero)","291":"Why did this movie get so much hype this summer???? It sucked!!! People said this was the best comedy of the summer, what the hell??!! Road Trip was definetly the best comedy. Scary Movie was nasty and stupid. There was only a few funny parts but not many. I think it should have been rated NC-17. It contained a lot of un-necessasry cursing and nudity. Don't waste your time and money of this terrible movie!","292":"How could the makers of this film get away with this trash?  The humor is sophomoric and at times disgusting.  The film makers rely on terrible gross out gags for laughs with terrible results.  I can not stand this film. Nobody should be forced to sit through this landfill.","293":"Scary movie was a sad attempt to satarize real &quot;scary movies.&quot; In addition to it's predictability, it was filled with bland humor. Oh yes, some parts did make you smile, perhaps even giggle, but over all it was a waste of my $7.00. It's only one of many movies today making an effort to mock popular teen movies. My suggestion, see a real teen movie. Because you know the joke you're in for when you go to see it.","294":"tedious, regurgitating half digested bits of existing horror movies, this is strictly for morons","295":"I can't see the movie on DVD.  Same problem as others have had.  It starts with the FBE warning and stays there.  You can't get past it.  Only way out is to eject the DVD unseen.  Stupid.  I've tried 4 copies from Blockbuster and Hollywood Video with same results.  I even tried it on my computer DVD and it hangs up.<p>Somethings wrong here.<p>I going to return the DVD and get the VHS.","296":"I enjoyed watching this laugh-your-but-off comedy that parodies Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. I loved it from beginning to end; there  was at least three or four laughs A MINUTE! If you love comedies this is  the movie to see. It's better than I expected!","297":"Vulgar, stupid, not funny, and lot of toilet humor. Overall: GARBAGE.","298":"The first Scary Movie is just 120 minutes of dumb jokes. Some of which are waaaay too offensive for younger viewers.<p>The second movie is a lot different. Its actually funny! I recomend buying part 2, and go to see part 3 next month in theaters.","299":"The movie is totally great...  I would buy it... if it would work!  Scary Movie has a defect in it that doens't let it play on some DVD players.  I know JVC, Hitachi, and other DVD players are not able to play this movie...  So do some research and call your DVD player company and see if they are having problems with Scary movie as well.  Hopefully the manufacturers of Scary Movie do a recall as many places have removed the DVD from the shelves because of the high return rate.","300":"It is in my opinion that this movie was horrible. The purpose of it was to make fun of other horror films but they did not do a good job. In fact it was stupid. Who wants to waist 8 dollars on a movie ticket to see people act like characters they have already seen-- no-one. This movie can be summed up in about two words-- a joke! I give this film 1 star because that is the most it deserves.","301":"This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It is Sick, Sick, Sick,.  It makes scream I Know what you Did Last Summer look stupid stupid stupid stupid .  The efects are crap crapy crapy.  The must vile movie series ever made.<p>Am buddy who watches this series, is weird, dumb, or a fool.  Don't watch this six movie ug or its sequels.  This movie sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks.  For the love of horrror it sucks.  I hope the people who directed it go bankrupt. <p>I rather watch dumb Chukey and day  thant this.","302":"This movie was mainly about all the other scary movies of the summer. They combined them and made an r rated comedy. It had lots of nudity and adult  language. They took certian parts out of other movies and put them all  together and got a bunch of garbage that didn't make any sense.<p> Next  time I will read reviews about movies before I spend my money. They should  give all the money they made to a charity and never try to make another  movie of this sort.","303":"Terrible movie. Raunchy, disgusting. Not even funny. Save your money.","304":"If you have the regular DVD, do not buy the Blu-ray. It is the worst Blu-Ray DVD I have seen, there is no high def in this transfer. The picture looks digitalized and I was very disapointed with this purchase, don't waste your money on this one.","305":"This is one of the worst comedy movies of all time. It seemed like the writers were trying so hard to make it funny, their efforts were way too obvious. It was like the writers were taking a multiple choice test on sophmoric humor. The jokes were not even all that raunchy. I could see that it was funny if you were a) drunk or stoned, b)13 years old, or c)a mental defective. It's better when comedy seems effortless in execution.<p>The Farley Brothers RULE!","306":"The trailers made the move look absolutely hilarious for one reason: they showed ALL or darn near all of the funny scenes.  During the entire movie, you expect and wait for them and there is no comical pay-off; You have already seen them and know the outcome.  In between the known gags are terrible, terrible ones.  They do produce a laugh just because of their utter stupidity and gross-out factor.  Bottom line:  Haven't seen the trailer?  Rent the film.  Seen the trailer?  You've seen the movie.","307":"This one should have been rated R. It's stupid, disgusting and not scary at all. I got to laugh a couple of times and that was it. I value my time at theaters, and movies like this one really upset me.","308":"First, let me say that this is not my type of humor.  That is my bias.  That being said, Scary Movie is the type of movie that begs and pleads for you to laugh at every given moment.  It almost looks like the actors just pause for an instant and wait for you to burst out into tear-filled hysteria.<p>The movie is what it is.  There's no point in saying this movie isn't intelligent-that wasn't the goal here.  If you like sight-gags and parody driven plots - then rejoice because this is your movie!","309":"Another Tom Cruise 'slice of life' film in which he plays a budding bartender. You can't go very far with that synopsis. All budding bartenders eventually realize there's more to life. This is like the characters from &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; with credit cards.","310":"This movie is one of those sublimely awful movies that should be savored line by line, wretched moment by wretched moment.  As truly awful as \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\"  So awful it's terrifying at first, then mesmerizing, then strangely exhilirating--I mean, can people really conceive of something THIS bad?  The \"Best Worst\" Film of the entire 80s, by a long shot.","311":"If you don't know what I.Q. is, but if you did, you are sure you could count your's without takeing off more than one shoe ( only if you are sure ) you may enjoy this film.","312":"God what a turkey! But it was the 80's afterall.","313":"Whatever were they thinking when they dreamed up this one!? What's next, a movie glorifying busboys??","314":"The movie itself is great. I'm a big fan of Fast and Furious movies... For this item (both theatrical and extended versions), I noticed that at one part of the movie (where Dom & Bryan are having conversation that they will do the final job and disappear forever), the film stopped at the part of Dom's line \"...forever\" with no sound and continued again.:-(( I watched this in the big screen and didn't notice that.","315":"I don't know why so many people like this movie.Sure it had cool cars but that alone doesn't make it a good movie.I thought it was boring.I usually like Dwayne Johnson but I just didn't like him in this movie.I didn't really care for any of the characters except for Han.He's the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.Maybe If I was a guy or if I was into racing,I would've like it better.This movie was to long and I was glad when it was over.","316":"It was an entertaining movie and I'd watch it again, because of the action.  I found the dialog to be a bit corny and some of the behavior unnecessary (you found the hideout and they're on satellite.  Is it necessary to be fly'n thru the streets and bouncing around in your armored cars to get to their location?)","317":"Worst out of the \"Fast\" franchise. Outrageously unrealistic. The whole thing was ridiculous. Would not waste my time on this.","318":"i have quite a few blurays and hddvd's and they are all uniform height. i have adjusted the shelves to fit them. So i order this bluray and it comes in a FULL SIZE CASE that now will now fit on my shelf. NOT COOL, very dissapointed.","319":"Yes its a small issue, but when you buy a Blu Ray it should come in a blu ray case.  All I have are blu rays on my shelf and this one doesn't fit.  Needs to be the little blue jeweled case like all other blu rays.","320":"This part of the Fast and Furious franchise was the worst of them all to me. Some people may think diferentely about it but I thought it was horrible and too long and drawn out. Hang it up guys.","321":"I don't know if this movie is good or bad. As soon as I try to play it on my Playstation 3 it locks it up hard and I'm forced to unplug it to shut it down.  I'm forced to rate this at 1 star for being the only brand new DVD I've ever had that won't work on my PS3. I have also made sure to update my PS3 to the latest version.","322":"I purchased this product because the title of the product advertised \"... + Digital Copy in DVD Packaging\" I was extremely upset and dissapointed when I found that the digital download code had expired and is not redeemable. Misleading Advertisement!!","323":"I bought this for a friend who likes movies with no plot beyond car crashes, explosions, bullets flying, and women with long hair.  He loved this movie. Say no more. I watched the movie at his house with Wall-O-Sound or whatever it is that blasts the noise at you loudly from all directions. It is used effectively in this movie. It is overused so frequently that I advised him to check his house foundation after the movie.","324":"pretty darn un realsitic  kinda a cowboy movie with cars  painfully predictable  so un realistic it hurts","325":"By the end of this movie you will be banging your head against the wall.  Here is a breakdown:  -Not too many cars and the driving is just stunts, no real driving  -The Rock and Vin Diesel fight and.... Vin Diesel wins!?!?  -Extremely long and pointless chase scene at the end where the director is just throwing away money crashing a lot of ford explorers in south america because it's cheap  -The only good part of this movie watching jordana brewster onscreen, but by the end im sick of everything on the screen.","326":"should've saved my five bucks and rented transformers. what a stupid, stupid movie. i expected stupid, but i really expected a little more entertainment. boring and retarded.","327":"One of the worst movies i've seen in years. I wish I could have the time spent being bored by it, returned to my life. Definitely Vin Diesel's worst ever. Don't spend any pesos on this piece of crap.","328":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. I was very excited to watch the Fast Five but when I opened it nothing was on the disc it was blank. So very disappointed!","329":"I'm glad I only paid 99 cents for this disaster. The only reason I finished it was to see if it would get worse. It did. Anyone over the age of 12 who gave this movie more than two stars needs to finish middle school and high school or get their G.E.D.","330":"I was perorder the combo packaging, because i like the firm Fast Five. but the Bluray disc sfter enter playmovie was no sounds. I don't want just because $20 than spen my time to return, but this was made me mad.","331":"After watching this movie and seeing the reviews posted here, I hope for the sake of our country that the studios are paying people to post 5 star reviews. This is the worst movie I have seen in decades. I would go through everything that I found jaw dropping stupid about this movie but I need to begin my healing process and try and forget.","332":"I preordered this movie on sept 24, they said i won't get it until oct 12. Thats to long, should've went to walmart.","333":"i haven't seen this movie  but i guarantee it doesn't deserve  a 4 and a half rating so just on that i give it 1 out of 5","334":"Movie was absolutely good. But I was very disappointed to find out it was a rental and it did not permit me enjoy the extras (features or bonus). I will surely read betternext time. I felt cheated.","335":"The first 30 minutes of the movie are nearly completely unintelligible.  The camera work and post editing are so fast and disconnected in any discernable manner as to make this mostly unwatchable.  It was like an epileptics worst nightmare.  The story was absurd, the acting terrible, but so much worse was the production.  Avoid.","336":"States that will play on DVD, BLU-RAY & PS3!! Does not fit in ps3 slim had to void ps3 warranty to remove disc does not fit in my Philips DVD player or Sony and Samsung blu-ray players!!!!!","337":"Universal, for some reason, has elected to continue to produce these double sided disks that contains the Blu-ray movie on one side and the DVD on the flip-side. Why is it that Universal cannot follow in Disney's lead and release these movies as two disk sets. Disney has combo disks that contains the Blu ray and DVD version in the same release, but the DVD and Blu ray disks are on separate disks, utilizing single sided disks.  I seriously do NOT recommend this item for purchase.","338":"Viewers beware, this is just a bad imitation from the original Korean blockbuster - \"Old Boy\".","339":"Be careful ordering this it is from the UK and is in a different format than US. I cant watch it on my player.  Be careful!","340":"yeah, yeah, yeah we know this is the big Hollywood version..but you have to see the original Playhouse 90 version, with Cliff Robertson and Piper Laurie!! its available on VHS (I have it) and 10 times better than this retread....Piper Laurie was incredible...CLiff Robertson says that when he lost the film version to Lemmon, Lemmon said \"I didn't think you'd be able to play comedy\"...to which Robertson replied; \"I didn't think 'Days of Wine & Roses' was a comedy\"..it's all there in the supplemental material on the VHS....see it instead of this version!!","341":"I was unaware that there were \"Zone\" issues and I couldn't play a UK DVD in Texas. Should've been a clear warning on the selection and not on the package after I bought it.   And I didn't need suggestions to purchase a universal code player!","342":"The DVD was riddled with pithy comments by the director who is himself a recovering alcoholic. I found these interuptions most annoying since they drowned out the dialogue of the movie.","343":"I can't review an item you haven't sent me yet.","344":"First off, I have to say that I love this show. So why the 1 star rating? Because this set is not worth it!! I just bought these items individually at about $12 each!!. These 4 seasons come out to about $17 each. I'm trying to save some people money!","345":"My grandson LOVES Blue's Clues and I paid and downloaded the first episode of this season, only to find that it couldn't be transferred to a DVD for him to watch - so as far as I'm concerned, Amazon Instant Video is a major rip-off.","346":"When playing the DVD the voices were nearly inaudible. I had to turn the volume to maximum and even then it was difficult to understand the words in quite a few places.  Guests watching the DVD agreed that the problem was significant.","347":"I'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I've ever tried to sit through. Don't be fooled by artsy film snobs, this one is a snoozer. And oh by the way, the tenacious \"loyalty, devotion and integrity\" of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film, is in my opinion, distracting and ridiculous.","348":"I thought this the MOST BORING  movie of all times!  Gag me!  Two great stars, dull movie.","349":"I loved Angel Heart.  I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon.  I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version.  However, it was also rated R.  It looks like I will have to buy it here locally.  The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.  If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version.","350":"Bad special effects, a shark with two heads which both manage to roar while underwater, poor acting, dumb dialogue and delivery of it, and more!  All very silly but worth a cheap rental just to make fun of it.","351":"I don't know what the other reviewers have been watching. Luckily, I searched youtube for some excerpts from this concert before buying it, and it is so painful to watch. Shannon Hoon would be dead shortly after this concert, and the reason is quite obvious when looking at this footage. Shannon looks so stoned he can barely stand. His voice sounds accordingly... Poor guy, I felt so sorry for him. I purchased the \"Letters from a porcupine\" dvd, instead.","352":"This movie was not what I expected.  I was looking for nostalgia, instead I got different scenes from bugs bunny shows, all of which had nothing to with Easter.  Save your money and do a search on youtube.","353":"One of the worst zombie films made. As is so often the case with \"no budget\" films, the film makers had some good ideas, but not enough money to pull them off. Might be real instructive for aspiring film makers. I did not hate it, but don't predict you won't.","354":"not much action nor history but marginally better than their other films...Another day at an reenactment..except your feet don't hurt after..","355":"Have many blu-rays.  Lots of concerts.  A lot of hype has been written about this blu-ray concert, so I bought it without hesitation.  Now about 2 years later, I have watched it ONCE.  Boring.  Boring.  Try renting it.  Not for everyone.","356":"I collect many Blue-Ray concerts... This was the worst and gave it away. I was expecting something better considering the reviews on here.. Guess there are a lot more hard core Dave Mathew groupies than I thought.. I have overlooked bad Video\/Audio because the artist did a good job.  I would have been upset if I paid to see this..","357":"I had to splice out about 30 minutes of crowd noise [applause?] and crude comments by Dave to have a listenable disc.  Dave is talented, unfortuately his ego preceeds all his performances like oobleck seeping everywhere.....","358":"I bought this tape because the search engine brought it up when I asked for \"Song Of The South\".  It is just a tape of sing-a-long children songs which includes Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah from Song Of The South.  A good tape if that is what you really wanted.","359":"...just exactly how will children learn from our mistakes in the past if people censor them as if they never happened?","360":"This tape is good and we all love the songs but the tape is only 15 minutes long...kind of a dud really.... thank you...","361":"This is an absolutely terrible movie, but well worth having in the collection if only to see Jack Nicholson slim and with hair and young. Made in 5 days, yes only 5 days, on the sets used for The Raven, this is one of the best bad films ever made, and as such is hugely enjoyable. Consider it as part of Corman's Edgar Allen Poe series and you will know what you are getting.It's quite short too.....","362":"Not the actual movie I was looking for, but an ok 70s flick. It was a good 'B' flick. Seemed drawn out though.","363":"I love City Hunter. But the people selling City Hunter 3 and '91 must have learned selling techniques from drug dealers. I was able to buy the first two seasons of City Hunter, which are like - 52 episodes each, mind you - for between 20 and 30 bucks. Now they want over two hundred dollars for a season that's not even half the usual amount of episodes? And I mean I love that show, but that's ridiculous.","364":"An obnoxious attempt to make a screwball comedy: a deranged girl plots to get a guy by literally running into him.  She decides on the spot he's the one for her, based solely on superficial appearances, and then she begins stalking him!  That she succeeds in getting this guy is something that could only happen in a movie as dopey as this. Jami Gertz's performance was one long screech while Dylan McDermott's was based solely on his ability to smile and look good.  This was no Cinderella story; this is why they have restraining orders!  Not a keeper!","365":"I think this movie is truly a fantasy movie for the women who grew up in trailers in this country.  Which guy in the right mind would actually  give up his career that he worked so hard all his life just for some low-class,broke, uneducated woman that ran into his $70,000 car?  On top of that, this movie portrayed this woman to be a \"sweet, innocent\" working class girl from Jersey who is not after his money?  Who are they kidding here?","366":"The first two films of this trilogy are great. If you have never seen them, I recommend that you go to your local rental store and rent them. As for this one, it's horrible. This is the worst one to me. I hated the theme park story, or was it just the theme park music that was annoying? Anyway, avoid it.","367":"Now this is one movie that made me want to get up and leave the movie theater! I regret paying my hard earned money to see this badly put out, predictable, boring plot.","368":"Part 1 and part 2 were great. Whenever a 3rd part comes out or even a 4th and so on I am always skeptical because they usually suck. This movie was no different. Weak plot, boring as heck and the actors are wastedbecause they werent even given good lines. I own a huge collection od DVDs and I own part1 and part 2 and I wouldnt add part 3 if someonegave it to me for free!","369":"My family (ages 77, 70, 50, 18, 16, 14, and 44) really enjoyed the first 2 Beverly Hills movies, however the third one only got thumbs up from grandma. It lacked the freshness of the first 2, and was instead a typical cliched sequel. Boring.","370":"If you are well versed in scripture and possess Wisdom and Knowledge, you will not be pleased with this movie.  The knowledge offered in this movie is watered down with doubts. There is no hard hitting truth, and the outcome is unrealistic. Look else where for truth to build on. This is not a resource for the watch of Him who comes like a thief in the night. I would say that this movie deserves 2 stars.","371":"over the years this movie has ignorantly used over and over as a tool of evil. there, i said it.  and YES, i absolutely am a christian.  fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.  the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman-> most importantly, THE RAPTURE IS NOT BIBLICAL !!!!!!  this is a weird fear based agenda that has no place in the kingdom.","372":"How can we buy this product without knowing the titles?  This happens TOO OFTEN on Amazon!  I might be interested if I knew exactly what I'm purchasing.  Thanks!","373":"received dvd that would not play in my area.  attempting to exchange now for one that will play in louisville ky","374":"Just on the basis of viewing the 1st 2mins of this version of Get Carter, I would never purchase the DVD.  I've seen the original (UK) version of it, and this ain't it!  Why were Sid Fletcher's and Geralds' voices overdubbed?!?!?!?  God only knows what else was edited and overdubbed!  Charlie Tesoro","375":"gritty, though it is, this movie is very boring.  caine turns in an ok performance, but the only saving grace of the movie is some quite beautiful nude girls.  other than that, nothing else worth mentioning.  stick with the godfather if you want a good crime movie","376":"I never got this product.  I recieved an e-mail that mentioned, the product was returned to the whare-house, and my money was re-funded","377":"I so wanted this movie to be great.  Or even good.  But it's neither.  In fact, it borders on being down right bad.  Stiff acting, tired premise, laughable special effects.  I give it two and a half stars, though, because it did magage to hold my interest.","378":"I am a huge fan of the musical version of this film.  It is so deliciously bad that it completely won me over... I found it completely captivating--I was horror-struck and yet completely fascinated by the songs--a curious concoction of faux-opera (think &quot;kill the wabbit&quot;)--interspersed with the cornball melodrama.  I have no idea why the musical version has fallen into disrepute... the humorless non-musical version will bore you to tears--it is no fun at all.  Until they release the MOST EXCELLENT musical version of this film, do not buy this!","379":"This should have been a better quality production - not sure why it failed to entertain...","380":"Although the film stars Kerwin Mathews and Torin Thatcher, both from &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; and is directed by the same director  of that film, Nathan Duran, this is a much weaker film.  The stop-motion  work is nowhere near as polished as Harryhausen's and the score by Paul  Sawtell pales in comparison to the brilliant Herrmann one for the earlier  flick.","381":"How utterly disapointing... I had no idea that there was a non-musical version of Jack The Giant Killer.  Terrible acting, awful costumes, lame plot,  without the songs this movie is a drabby bore.  The goofy songs are the key to this otherwise DULL movie.","382":"The costumes and sets aren't too bad, but otherwise this looks like a bad TV movie from the 70s usually does. I agree that there is less of the melodrama than in Cecil DeMille's film, but the writing and acting are still painful to watch, and the picture is always dark. It must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by, because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking.","383":"Great actor, absolutely terrible movie. So bad that it is almost funny.","384":"this movie stinks i strongly dislike it what makes me wanna hate this movie even more is that french stewart is in it this movie stinks french stewart is one lousy lazy actor this movie stinks do not waste your money on this terrible movie buy something else instead","385":"Both my wife and I are into gaming, but not this type of dress-up\/act out gaming.  Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the \"players\" gave it their all. They were ignoring \"game decorum\" every 10 seconds or so, so it really made everyone look half-hearted and  silly. There were a few comedic moments here and there which were ok, but the drama was totally uninteresting. Maybe there is a good story here somewhere, but neither my wife nor I could get into this film.  A big thumbs down for us!","386":"I didn't think this was particularly well done... in comparison with the book it can't hold a candle. I was surprised at the good quality of the film, for being so old. I didn't think that most of the actors looked right for the parts, particularly Kat. And the movie dragged on and on and on....<p>I guess as I watched it I kept thinking of better ways this could have been filmed to coincide better with the powerful impact of the story. <p>See it if you like, but I really can't recommend it...","387":"Received DVD fairly quickly; however the DVD has several damaged places on it that would not play and I had a hard time getting past them.  I would have returned it, but I had already thrown the packaging away.","388":"It hasn't been that long since I rented this movie and I have already forgotten the thing. That might provide a clue as to how good a movie this is. I streamed it via Roku after paying Amazon for the privilege and though I think I paid less than $3.00 to rent it I still feel a bit ripped off. I cannot recommend this movie in any way.","389":"If you are looking for a good movie to watch at bedtime about a bunch of doctors walking around a hospital, then this movie is for you. Thats basically all that happens in this movie; NOTHING. If you watch this movie, here is what you will get - Sleepy","390":"I have to believe the positive reviews on this are fake... poor acting - low budget (which can still work but, not in this case) no zombies till last 15 minutes... weak... and I love zombie flicks... but, certainly not this one...","391":"I rented this film but did not have time to watch, but as soon as I am able to see it will review it. It has got some descent reviews since its release.","392":"This had to be the worst movie i have ever watched.  EVER!!!!  Don't waste your time renting or buying it.","393":"I hated it...way too cheesy and I thought she was way too fast and a terrible teacher.","394":"I am unable to play this Mary Poppins DVD as it is not for my region and will not play. My grandchildren were extremely disappointed and I felt I had been duped.  I think Amazon should send me a replacement that will play in Australia. I have bought before and always been happy, but will hesitate before I buy from Amazon again.","395":"The online streamed version of this movie is NOT widescreen. It is pan & scan and looks like a low-quality YouTube video circa 2003. I did a bandwidth speedtest showing 10 Mbps download but Amazon's video connect shows 1 of 5 bars, so their video server cannot handle decent quality video. Refund please.","396":"I guess you get what you pay for.  Only $2 plus another $2-3 for shipping.  It's a DVD for the UK or Ireland.  It's printed in tiny letters on the DVD.  I obviously thought I was buying a DVD for the U.S. Bummer","397":"P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character.  It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the \"real\" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons??  Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest.  I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old.  I agree with another reviewer--this is one of Disney's worst movies ever.  [...]","398":"I think it's a nice gift with a nice presentation, but once we watched the dvd it's was a little bit poor. I know italy very well and i have to say that this one it's like a \"museum\" description of the country, and you can not listen to native speakers talk in it's own language...you always have to do it in english...so sad.","399":"This is without a doubt the WORST informational dvd ever! The seller was great though, they refunded 20% of the purchase price.","400":"This cartoon was recorded in ep mode and is so badly done that you can hardly watch it.  It is such a shame that the people who made this tape are so cheap that they couldn't have used a better viewing mode.","401":"Although these are ok pilates moves, this is not a challenging workout.  I don't think this offers anything over standard pilates DVDs and is a bit slower than the ones I already own.","402":"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now.  They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it.  However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors.  Also the sound is very bad.  Some of the plots are a little boring.  But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality.  I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.  I just wish it was easier to watch.","403":"Central Park Drifter had potential, but lacked good acting abilities.  DVD has a good cover, nudity, sex, and violence.","404":"I have watched the movie long time ago, and i enjoyed every moment of it, i was so glad i found it in amazon but when i ordered i was shocked to find that the box was simply empty! where was the DVD?!! i am so disappointed.","405":"Most of this is filmed right on the beach with the wind blowing into the mic.  You can't understand about 90% of what they're saying!  Very low quality\/amateur. - don't bother.","406":"Did I mention the fact that this is a Boring movie.I drank 7 beers and watched this movie.Thinking it had potential since it's about satanism and the like.Also it was suppost to have nudity in it but it didn't,at least my copy didn't.It appeared to have had 3 differant scipts of the movie piced together resulting in a big mess.Nothing scary or exciting here except a big waste of your time.","407":"Dumb movie about your typical Cult(cults suck) and a bunch of naive idiot followers,sadly this topic has been done ad-infinity,Cult movies are the worse.","408":"This version of the movie is from \"RHINO\" and is edited not full version of the movie. So unfortanately I have to say I did not enjoy the movie at all","409":"Before you buy anything from Teaching Systems ensure whether it is available in standard Deviants.  The Standard Deviants prices are cheaper compared to Teaching Systems, though the products are one and the same.","410":"Holly Mother of Mitra is this a big steaming pile of drug induced excrement or what? How I set through this is beyond me, I just keep thinking it would get better, after all there is plenty of sex and gore and more sex you don't want to see all mixed up in a big sorry pitiful excuse for a movie. Save your time or fast forward to the good parts because this movie sucks.","411":"It's so obvious that someone's trying to make a statement about the use of drugs,that I wondered if the movie was financed by the DEA. Two minutes of alright gore&shock,but that's it. It's something you could show in schools to scare the little kids but it's NOT A GOOD MOVIE. Big regrets I bought this one.","412":"Too bad there are no ZERO stars.. This \"thing\" would get it.  OK, Parker WAS working for Elvis and so on.  But apart from that, which is extremely minor, WHAT is this thing doing under \"Elvis Presley\" when you search for new Elvis Presley DVD's?  Amazon sure had a strange way to put things together.  Go ahead try it: Type \"Elvis Presley\" in DVD search and you'll get a certain number of DVD's... including this.  Come on Amazon... wake up!","413":"I just bought this film on the recommendation of a friend. It is, by far, one of the most annoying films I?ve ever seen. Basically you get five guys yelling for two hours. The plot is transparent and the characters two-dimensional. I seldom take time to write a negative review but this movie is just so awful.","414":"What a horrible mess!  Despite a great cast, a great premise and a first-time, promising director, the movie fails miserably to succeed. It's like a terrible, missguided experiment in black humor.  Those in search for  a true black comedy should try Todd Soldonz's &quot;Happiness&quot;.  Those  who think that Christian Slater's role was a good &quot;Jack  Nicholson&quot; imitation, should take a look at &quot;Heathers&quot;, and  those who think Cameron Diaz was truly wicked, should watch &quot;The Last  Supper&quot;.  'Nuff said.","415":"If you enjoy watching people scream, fight and kill through an entire movie, then you'll love this one.  If not, don't bother.  No redeeming value whatsoever.  I'd give this negative stars if I could.","416":"I was drawn to this movie because it was billed as a &quot;dark comedy&quot; I thought that meant that it was supposed to be funny, at least on some level.  But, it wasn't funny (darkly or in any other way).  It was not suspensful because it was predictable.  It did however feature a  very hip cast... except for Daniel Stern and Leland Orser who provided us  with the extremities of acting (overacting and no acting).  This movie  reminded me of the late HBO series Tales From the Crypt, minus the  cryptkeeper.","417":"****MAJOR SPOILER****DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****  Before I invested time watching this, I wish I had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end.  I wouldn't have bothered, it wasn't that good anyway.  Maybe this review will save someone.  Giving it 2 stars because I've seen abyssal films that only deserve 1-star, and this is not that bad.","418":"This film was just awful, and I decided not to waste my time finishing it.  Everything about it was bad, from start to finish-  at least to the finish line that I chose.  A real stinkeroo.","419":"The cliche's:  1. The supportive wise black friend, 2. The overbearing to the point of unbelievable mother 3. The hero is perfect, has higher ideals than Jesus 4. When he goes into convulsions on the floor, I thought, here we go, he's dying of cancer, sure nuff  Worst movie I've seen in a while, then again, I'm not female, nor under the age of 16.","420":"There is handicap and deadly disease, poverty, alcoholism, loss of a parents during childhood and super abusive mother. All that topped off with great love and forgiveness. Little bit overdone even for my (romantic) taste.","421":"I've lost all faith in reviews. I'm one of the most generous star-givers out there, and I could not find anything good about this movie. I chose it based on reviews, but I just can't believe that anyone, let alone a majority, could give this 5 stars.  Beware of this one unless you like sappy, poorly acted, unrealistic films, with really bad music.  I hung in there until the end waiting for it to get better, but it just kept nose-diving deeper and deeper.","422":"I am an avid fifties sci-fi buff, but this movie was really sadly put together even for back then. I gave it two stars because of the effort. It really could have been a great movie if it was for the \"special effects\" ... they were really special.","423":"This movie is, in a word, hilarious. I defy anyone to watch it and not have tears streaming down their face from laughter. It's one of those classic, uproariously insane comedies in the Monty Python style, just plain crazy funny. I am an animal lover but even the part where the poodles that get annihilated was hilarious and Michael Palin's reactions to that are beyond funny.  This is one movie that is guaranteed to make you scream with laughter.  I have seen it about a dozen times and it still makes me laugh till I cry.","424":"I loved Kevin Kline in \"Dave\" and Jamie Lee Curtis in \"Trading Places\", so I sadly wasted my time and money on this vulgar and silly garbage.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!","425":"Fear not, DVD fans, a brand new Special Edition version will be released in the first quarter of 2002!","426":"This gut-busting comedy starring Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese and Michael Palin deserves better.  The DVD has the worst sound I've ever experienced on DVD or VHS.  If you're used to 5.1 sound, mono just doesn't cut it.  It's one of my favorite comedies, and maybe my most disappointing DVD.","427":"You can usually expect intense, provocative movies from Oliver Stone. He achieved something special with JFK and Nixon. I was expecting this would also be provocative and really have an opinion about Bush. Instead, its just a boring, standard biography. No insight or and special messages. A real disappointment.","428":"A let down...pretty boring.  I didn't even finish the whole thing.  I rented it mainly because of Josh Brolin and his past roles.","429":"the acting was good, I thought it was a fair depiction of our former president. Not too negative and not too positive, The acting was very good","430":"W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know. Although George was almost charming in this movie, it didn't tell us anymore than we've already seen on CNN. Personally I was hoping to see a little about the year before 911 and maybe some Paul O'Neil.","431":"The movie was a clear attempt to make Bush look like a complete fool.  Did Stone really need to show him in the bathroom wiping????  Is Bush always eating?  When he eats is he always talking?  Is the Bush family really that dysfunctional and hateful to each other?  I know its just one mans \"story\" of another mans life, but it almost seemed like it could have been done by Michael Moore as it was so one sided.","432":"This is a mixture of some truth mixed with a liberal viewpoint.  Oliver Stone made a statement to the movie world thru his own beliefs as usual.  I found it cruel and unfair to our former president. The only good thing was I think the actors did a good job with accents.  I bought this to give to my Dad (who is a Democrat) thinking he would like it, but I am too embarrased to give it to him now.  People deserve their dignity, and I don't think it was given in this movie.","433":"I didn't need this boring, long winded movie to tell me just how insane, stupid and inbred that man really is.  I was awake for the last eight years.  Try to avoid this movie, unless you weren't.","434":"WARNING!!! THIS title does NOT work on AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS. Contrary to what this web site says, IT IS REGION ONE!!!","435":"As someone said in an earlier review, \"If you hate Bush, you'll probably like this...\"  Well, I hate Bush and I hated the movie!  Unlike with Nixon, Stone was too easy on him.  I suspect, however, that the film reflects most of the truth.  As much as I diagree with all that Bush was about, I think that he was genuine in his love for this Country and meant the best for it.  I was just a bit shocked that Stone let him off the hook so easily.","436":"I think the movie, \"W\" was well-done, although it's not my favorite.  That's probably because it's about politics, one of my least favorite subjects.  Richard Dreyfuss and Josh Brolin were the only actors I knew by name, but the movie still held my attention with all the punches 'George W. Bush' gave; that was what made the movie interesting.","437":"This film is an awful insult to a GREAT president, I am unfathomably appalled by how the average American feels towards Bush. He was a vital asset to this country in very trying times, he had to make some extremely difficult decisions during his time in office and I think that he made nearly every single one of them correctly. This movie is merely a statement of the ignorance of the American public, primarily those in Hollywood. Do not support this propaganda!","438":"I don't like Oliver Stone and his movies (except World Trade Center) and I think he's a stupid film maker. This movie is another failure like Alexandre and JFK..... I think one star is even too much for it. ((BDS stands for Bush Derangement Syndrome - I believe Oliver Stone suffers from BDS too))","439":"but even that is cutting. You watch and say \"He was elected twice!\" What will future generations say?","440":"i saw nixon the day prior and to say i was let down by this one is an understatement... brolin was decent, whoever played the part of rice was horrible... it just seemed like a really poorly acted, scripted movie... no insights, no real life portrayals of the struggles in the white house, especially between bush and cheney in the later years... turned those 8 horrible years into a joke... a horrible joke most of us have suffered through...","441":"This film is just a political cartoon showing a caricature of George Bush.  I've seen George Bush interviews on TV many many times.  I've read books about Bush from several different authors.  (I read a lot of books about historical figures.)  My Dad has interacted with George W Bush.  The film fails to show the friendly compassionate Bush that so many talk about.  I'm no fan of George W Bush's politics, but this film is a flat one sided approach to a person who has a friendly compassionate side that doesn't show up in the film.","442":"This movie is worth watching only if interested in some facts and history. The world's rotten politics is amazing. The politicians and analyst are worse. The acting is not worth mentioning. This is not a recommended movie","443":"...by not buying Fox's idiotic attempt to colorize one of the great screen classics. Yikes, will they NEVER learn?!?!?","444":"This is the worst transfer to dvd that I've ever seen.  My vhs copy from TCM is much better!  I love the film, but was bitterly disappointed at the shoddy treatment.  Shame!!!","445":"This is a terrible movie version of a pretty exciting book. Frank Sinatra was and never could be Joseph Ryan. He was totally miscast in this role. I have a feeling he was a producer who acquired the rights for himself thinking that he could play the part. So wherever you are, Frankie, it didn't work!","446":"My daughter has an old cartoon \"Josie and the Pussycats\" video from years ago which she likes to watch.  So when she wanted to buy this DVD with her Amazon credit, I said \"sure.\"  I am sorry I did.  The characters are evil and nasty.  One character in particular uses an excessive amount of bad language to get her point across.  The story line is completely vapid.  This was a waste of money and I've hidden it so my daughter can't watch it again.","447":"You don't get much dumber than this movie.. seriously it was horrible.  The only reason that I watched this was because it had a pretty good review on this website, where I get most of my reviews but I guess that reviews don't tell you everything.  Seriously, if you decide to watch this movie.. god help you, it is so bad and should never have been made.  Please, for the sake of your mental health, NEVER. EVER. EVER. watch this movie.","448":"The only reason to watch this movie is that there are cute girls in it.  If you like it for any reason other than that, you are stupid.","449":"First off. This comes as a DVD-R not a pressed DVD, so incompatibility might occur on some DVD Players.<p>That being said, this is DVD rip of a VHS master. It's ok, it's basically the fundamental of Wing Chun. Not very good in the details. No chapter stops. I believe it's only 30 minutes long.<p>I would say that the cost and quality exceeds the value of this DVD.","450":"The DVD cover looked good online but it is nothing more than a inkjet printed cover.  Poor audio.  No structure on topics covered.  Nothing more than a home video with the Master and his students demonstrating some aspects of wing chun. Could be better but for now really poor show.  For the price I paid for it, simply not worth the money.","451":"The DVD contains everything that the editorial review promises but in really poor quality. The DVD disc is a DVD-R that the manufacturer reproduced very cheaply and although the cover says that it is digitally remastered, the quality of the DVD is really quite appalling, being very amateurish and in some parts, simply not watchable. Although the content will make me watch it again, I'm really disappointed that I've had to pay so much for something of such poor quality.","452":"I was very excited to get this dvd, as an avid practioner of Shorin-Ryu.  However, the dvd left a lot to be desired.  There is very lot footage of Soken, and the majority of the footage that is shown can be found on youtube for free.  I think that this was just a sad attempt of George Alexander attempting to make money again.  I would not waste your money, just search for Master Soken on youtube and you will have everything that this dvd has to offer.","453":"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the cheap packaging of Season Nine and Ten.  All of the others were nicely packaged and these two seasons came in a cheap plastic DVD holder!  Had I known this in advance I may not have spent the money to buy them.  I HOPE the final season is NOT packaged this way because I have pre-ordered it!","454":"I just received my 10th season and all 4 discs were all badly scratched.  CBS\/Paramount's quality of their DVDs is the worse of all studios.  I think because they have so many rights to TV shows and are putting them out at a fast pace, regardless of the quality of the DVDs.  CBS\/Paramount needs to get their act together and start putting out quality unscratched DVDs.","455":"Dogma has some funny moments and contains the kernel of a good film, but unfortunately these are lost in the loose direction and  slack editing.  There are quite a few plot problems and they are never really resolved properly. A few more months in the editing suite may have worked wonders for this film, but overall it was very disappointing. <p>Ed Wood would've been proud.","456":"Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy are all classics and I think that must have weighed heavily on Kevin Smith when he made this film.<p>All the bits which captured your imagination and funny bone in the first three movies are gone, what you are left with is a movie with very little to offer.<p>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon bring some star power to the movie, but to be honest, the earlier movies worked better with a higher proportion of little known actors.<p>It just doesn't work as a movie!","457":"For me, this movie started out with the right amount of irreverant anti-religeous zeal, but then became perverted into just another gory chop  'em up &quot;road trip.&quot;  If it had stuck with the satirical humor it  could have worked better.  For me, it stopped being funny when the violence  became explicit.  The monster from the toilet was funny, and that type of  violemce (implied but not seen) made for a better film.  It is too bad that  it deteriorated into a &quot;I can make this more graphic than the last  movie made&quot; type movie.  It lost points with me.","458":"This was a DUMB movie no point ot it at all. A completely A list cat wasted in thie trash of a movie.<p>on dvd no good extras<p>rental only! 1<p>DOgma C-","459":"This movie would not have been so terrible if it was not supposed to be in line with the Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy series.  To those of us that truly enjoyed Clerks, there is no low budget elegance about this one.  There is no absence of the mainstream media explosion that you find in the other three (okay, maybe two, but we'll forgive Chasing Amy).  This movie may have ranked a four, but not tied to one of the best movie series ever.  It's like teats on a bull, it just don't belong.","460":"First of all...how did this film get made?  I mean, the actors don't even bother to act.  It looks like and sounds like a group of friends got together over one too many drinks and brainstormed this whole thing.  And good for them if they were able to get on the phone and convince a bunch of idiots to give them money to make it.  However, I think it's equally important to have a few drinks in you too in order to get the right buzz required to enjoy this film.","461":"OK, so get this: it's a movie about like, God and the apostles and angels, right?  But God is a WOMAN!!!  And the apostle is BLACK!!  And the angel is ALAN RICKMAN!!!  And nobody talks like the King James Bible! It's all like, jive!  HOLY SHIITE THAT'S BLASPHEMOUS!!!  YOU MIGHT LAUGH!!!  you have been duly warned  PS: They use the word \"sex\" in it. \"Sex is a joke,\" they say. That's an actual line of dialogue. I didn't know it was until I saw this flick of greatness. SEX!!","462":"Dogma is probably one of if not Kev's worst films. How a Catholic can Make this movie is beyond me. As a Catholic myself I wouldn't cross the line for the sake of \"Art\" if that's what people think art is that's their problem. Kevin is a very talented Guy as are the cast it's sad.","463":"I think what bothered me most about this movie was that it thought it had something intelligent to say. Unfortunately a more cogent argument against religious dogma could be formulated by a 4 year old. And then there's the script. Was this a first draft? The acting was also horrendous, with incredibly annoying performances by Rock, Damon, and Affleck, but with a script like this that was inevitable. In short, do not pay money to see this garbage! Kevin Smith is a one trick pony and needs to stick to stories involving New Jersey and convenience stores.","464":"this movie is boring, boring, boring. smith's flat satire lacks subtlety and grace and is redeemed (relatively speaking) only by its moments of ridiculous humor - a feces demon, horny jay, screeching chris rock et al. <p>the damn thing isn't even offensive, except in the sense i paid for the  rental. <p>cheap shot? worthy target.","465":"After Watching this film i feel Kevin Smith Should Seek a Real Job.this Film was Horrible.part Bill&amp;Ted's Excellent Adventure part History of the World part 1&amp;the Rest all junk.Chris Rock is Flat in this Film.same  goes for Linda Fiorentino.Matt Damon&amp;Ben Affleck add nothing to this  Poor Excuse of Film-Making.i see nothing funny in this Mockery of  Catholicism.it's a Travety that this Film was even ever made.","466":"Why does this movie suck this bad!this movie is dull and has no storyline.FACE THE FACTS.","467":"This movie goes so badly as movies can go... The duo of Damon and Affleck think they made a master-piece of controversy, but that's not case: it's  only a master-piece of boredom. Director kevin Smith forgot what film  making is all about. THe plot is horrenndous, Morrissette appears out of  the blue (clever agent..) nothing works here. Linda Fiorentino could have  been replaced by a door, so bad was her acting. Sad...","468":"I hardly ever write reviews here, but when this awful movie appeared like a lurking demon to the left of my monitor I knew something had to be done. This movie was so bad that I walked out about 5 minutes before it ended at the theater. The only advantage to it on DVD is that it can be destroyed. If you like movies with terrible scripts, not-funny toilet humor, bad acting, poor direction, etc, then you MIGHT find this tolerable. How anybody could like this travesty is beyond me.","469":"i saw this movie i should have brought with me my pillow and my blanket the movie was so bad i walked out of the movie holding my nose i should stayed at home and bored my self to sleep my friend thought that this  was a poor excause for a movie he said that it stunk even when we walked out we said why did we spend the money for this i should have saved my money  and bought baseball cards and i dont buy baseball cards","470":"This is without any doubt, the worst film I ever had the misfortune to see. Truly, impressively, stunningly awful, pretentious, stupid... just bad.","471":"\"Dogma,\" a film by Kevin Smith, is, in my opinion, a trite and confused bit of religious non-sense.  In one scene the characters appear to throw religion out the window in the interest of good-natured, irreverant fun, until all of it comes to a screeching halt, and the viewers find themselves suffering through sudden moments of sobriety in which either Matt Damon or his bland side-kick, Ben deliver their own silly attempts at homiletics.  Don't waste your money.  Pass this one by.","472":"Not clever, not funny.  With the amount of talent in this movie, how could someone miss so badly?  This movie is aboslutely one of the worst I have ever seen.","473":"While I am a fan of Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and usually Alan Rickman, and was raised Catholic so I can appreciate some of the jokes, this is close to the worst movie I've ever seen.  It gets one star because some of the performances are good, even if the story is dubious.  Sorry twentysomethings. The poop monster was right out of South Park humor, or perhaps Beevis and Butthead-also not my favorites.  And Alanis Morrisette as God?  Please.","474":"Both my husband and I came very near to walking out of this film in the theater. Matt and Ben were funny together in the past so we thought this was going to be a real treat. Well, the acting, production values, script, dialogue, intellectual depth - just everything about this thing was severely subpar. I can't believe they're trying to resurrect this piece of crap for new, unsuspecting audiences. Yes, I can believe it. Incredible.","475":"I wasn't offended by the subject matter of the movie, I was appalled by the writer's sophormoric views on religion. Read the Bible, don't waste your time watching this over rated piece of trash.","476":"Personally, I am a crude, profain marine.  Until I saw this show I thought nothing could offend me.  This group of usually good actors crosses the line.  I watched this show with a party of twenty-something people---none of them particularly religious---who all wanted to take a shower after watching this sickening show. Unless you aspire to be just like Maralyn Manson, you will wish you didn't watch it.  I consider seeing this movie one of the worst two hours I have ever spent.","477":"WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW.  THERE IS SO MUCH SWEARING, YOU NEED A LOT OF SOAP JUST TO CLEAN IT UP.  THERE IS NO FUN IN THIS MOVIE AND NO HAPPINESS.  JUST BLOODY SENSELESS KILLING.  THE MOVIE MOCKS THE CATHOLIC RELIGION WITCH IS VERY DISTASTEFUL.  DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE GOOD VALUES.","478":"The Bottom Line:  Saw begins promisingly by thrusting the viewer into a dirty basement with the two main characters, but quickly builds up so many plot holes that a good deal of the sequels' running lengths are devoted to clearing them up; if you like your horror leavened awful acting and nonsensical plotting, by all means check out Saw.","479":"Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1\/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal.","480":"I saw this in distribution. I actually had to turn my head at certain points. This, along with Trent Reznor's soundtrack made for a great splatter flick. I thought the uncut version could only be better.....WRONG. It is not nearly as tense and nerve-racking as the theater version. Plus, they have replaced Reznor's soundtrack with something else. In this case, the orginal was much better. Be warned!","481":"Acting: forget it. Story: Ludacrous. However the production design (sets, the puppet, killer mechanisms) and the cinematography are worth mentioning - although I can tell you now that the stylish overall look of this film will seem awfully dated in a dozen of years.  I'm giving this film 2 stars: one for the efforts of the production design team, the other one is to be shared by the marketing heads of the studio, the editor who cut one hell of a good trailer together and the graphic designer(s) who are responsible for the layouts of all promo material.","482":"I thought the story itself was really good and really interesting, however, I thought the acting was lacking. It did have some intense and suspenseful moments, but not as many as I was hopping for. I also wasn't scared at all, which really suprised me seeing as how the commercials looked really spooky. All in all I was very disappointed!  I did like how the movie ended, though.","483":"My husband convinced me to join him at a \"sneak\" preview of Saw this evening. Well I saw it and all I can say is I haven't laughed that hard since I saw Scary Movie. The only problem is I don't think this was supposed to be a comedy! Was it bad? Oh yeah! Is it worth renting? Oh no!","484":"This movie has a great plot but as it was one of the first released titles on Blu-Ray it has poor picture quality.  If you want to show off your new blu-ray player try to get some of the more recently released titles as they have much better picture quality.","485":"I believe this film had promise--at least in the beginning however it quickly descends into a horrific mess with tons of plot holes and a premise that is just shy of absurd.  Danny Glover is totally wasted and it's hard to believe he even did this movie.  Avoid.","486":"Wow, what [.....] and [....] what a piece of[....], this [.....]poor, [.......]. Everything [.....] this [....]movie is so [.....] lame!!!!! and the [.....]story of [....]bad, and a[......] little corny puppet????

Hollywood can [...]a fat[....] ,it's[....] stink's and[....]corny!!!!! Bad acting [....] .and [...] mainstream , but[....]a room [.....] ,just[.....] boring!!!!!!! I didn't like it.","487":"Ok, this movie is so stupid. It is not a scary movie AT ALL. It was boring, predictable, and only had a few moments that were really suspenseful. I can't believe that there's been three sequels from this movie. I mean, come on!!","488":"\"Saw\" is a badly acted movie with spotty writing and odd direction. The characters aren't believable and the twist at the end is even more unbelievable. Nothing rings true, unless you like gore for gore's sake.  This is not a horror movie in my opinion. It's simply a horror.","489":"I saw this movie for the first time on the SciFi channel. It is so poorly filmed that it could've been a made-for-tv movie. They must have had a very low budget to make it.","490":"to me this movie looked great in the previews and I always enjoy horror movies that critics give bad ratings to. But I agree with them this time. At first I thought I was going to sleep with the light on until I saw the ending. THE ENDING IS....... THERE ISN'T A REAL ENDING JUST A VICTIM BEING LOCKED IN A DARK ROOM. If you want to see a scary movie this isn't one to see unless you only like to watch the beginning of movies","491":"I rented this and what can I say? Well... you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it...  Awful acting? Check.  Awful story? Check.  Awful direction? Check.  Awful villian? Check.  Awful chemistry? Check.  Awful ending? Check.  To have this movie as a 3.5 star average and to even have ONE five star rating is a crime against God, humanity, and cinema... and maybe not in that order. If you are the brainless sort that finds Fear Factor to be \"good television\" then by all means, buy this NOW.","492":"I was sure that it would be really scary; however I was wrong. It is one of those movies which do not raise your heartbeat and do not have any real special effects. You can buy it maybe for your DVD collection, bout do not pay too much.","493":"For what is supposed to be a horror movie, I did not find it scary at all.  Instead I found it annoying and boring.  The two actors are either wrong for the roles or just did not know what they were doing.  What were they thinking when they made this ugly movie?","494":"A pointless plot, bad acting and the typical Hollywood formula for teeny-bopper horror movies. The ending made the movie go from crap to MAJOR crap. This movie is very scary and disturbing - for 3rd graders....  You want disturbing?  You want to be freaked out for weeks after a movie?  Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere - look up director Takashi Miike on Amazon, then try out Audition, Gozu, Ichi, etc.  But for all those who thought SAW was scary and disturbing, then forget it - you couldn't handle Miike.  Try Sesame Street.","495":"How does anyone say the Saw movies are better than Hostel,these movies don't deliver anywhere near the amoount of carnage that movies like Hostel and Wolf Creek do. These movies are soft enough for elementary kids to watch. The gore doesn't match up to Hostel and the story doesn't match up to Seven. This movie doesn't deliver on either level its suppose to.","496":"This movie works for about 45 minutes, then takes a horrible nose dive with some truly ridiculous plot twists. AND I was SO happy when Danny Glover got massacred in this movie. I actually stood up and clapped. Any detective who has his gun on the killer and doesn't get him, then loses him AGAIN after obsessing over the crime to the point of insanity, deserves to die. This movie was really dumb. Bad writing, bad acting (now we know where has-been actors like Cary Eiwes go to die). What a waste.","497":"I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it.  I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well.  WRONG!!!  This movie had poor acting as well as a very dark plot.  There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie.  In the end, you feel very cheated and wish you had the last 100 minutes of your life back.  If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!","498":"O.k.  I love how hollywood pumps up the hype on all these lame \" SO CALLED HORROR FLIMS!\" 2 guys in a room for a long time, Wow scary!! GO get SHAUN OF THE DEAD OR BUBBA HO-TEP! those are the only cool FUN movies out in a long time! Oh the new Texas chainsaw re-make was damn cool too.","499":"I'll keep it simple.  This is a trite and contrived attempt and making a thriller.  Basically the entire movie is stolen from previous thrillers like Seven.  The characters are boring and the acting is comically bad.  Danny Glover and the rest of the cast should be ashamed of themselves.  If you're like me you'll be hoping everyone dies at the end.  I love how people we're going on and on about how gross the movie was.  It was so weak. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie.  Save yourself the time and money.","500":"When the acting is so hideous that you want EVERYONE to die, it's really hard to find a movie appealing. If you really want a scare, watch Black Christmas. The writers should be ashamed of this trash.","501":"I purchased this item at a very good price but when I got it , it wasnt what the picture said it was.","502":"This movie is about some crazy guy nicknamed Jigsaw who kidnaps people and tries teach them lifes values, by putting them through sick twisted games.What the heck is that all about?!It is nothing but blood and gore throungh the whole movie! If I could give this movie 0 stars I would,it sucks!","503":"You heard me! This movie sucks. Everything about it is stupid. This film is disgusting. It is polution to your mind to watch this. Stay away.","504":"\"Cube\" is much scarier and better made, using a similar idea. Find out what happens to six people who wake up trapped in a mysterious white room that seemingly has no doors. Truly frightening!","505":"This movie was OK, it was kind of disturbing, but it was OK, The acting of Cary Lewis, I thought, was pretty bad. I really, really, did not like the ending. Other people who I have talked to said this movie was dumb, and I agree with them. The people who thought this movie was good, you obviously have no good taste in movies and believe me, I know movies, and I know when or when not to recommend them to people and this is one that I would not recommened.","506":"do not waste your time or money on this juvenile,lame-a** plot,piece of trash. if i was about,say..13,14, i'd say \"cool man,that was gory\",not caring about plot. but i'm 30yrs past that. i do love blood&guts so....but GD, there HAS TO BE A STORY LINE. anybody who liked this should think the\"faces of death\" tapes are the ultimate. put this one straight in the roundfile.","507":"la verdad que esto es un insulto para las personas...una pelicula...por demas sangrienta....con un argumento...terrible...pesimas actuaciones....realmente..hubiera preferido .. no verla  salduos","508":"This movie looks totally stupid.  I agree with the other reviewers, this is just a lame wannabe version of SEVEN.  It tries and wants so hard to be \"arty\" or \"crazy\" that it just isn't.  Silence of the Lambs was better.  For a Halloween movie, Nightmare before Christmas is still much better.  This is like a lame, ridiculous stereotype of the genre.  Boo, indeed.  Just another attempt to squeeze money out of a Holiday while putting no real feeling into a film.","509":"At first I really enjoyed this movie but the last half was okay and the ending was so excrucitaingly awful I fealt like I wasted an hour and a half just for a stupid ending like that.","510":"This film was stupid. What a let down. Looked very good in the trailers. Saw sucked!!!!!","511":"Wow, movies today are getting more repulsive and disgusting by the minute. No wonder we have so much teenage violence. This movie goes way too far as far as blood and gore goes. I mean, we dont need to watch some guy sawing his leg off and getting shot in the head. Directors are just trying anything they can to get a rise out of people these days, its pathetic. Save your money.","512":"SAW 2 IS COMING OUT.. IT'S CALLED  SAW 2 : SAWIN' LOGS (THIS YEARS FALL A-SLEEPER HIT)  SAW WAS LAME.. COME ON.. I AM A HORROR FAN & I THOUGHT THIS WAS LAME.. THE ACTING WAS STRAIGHT FROM HELL.. AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MOVIE WAS A \"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT\" SCENE.. THIS FILM WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS \"THE VILLAGE\" OWWWW WAS THAT ONE BAD! AND I WATCHED BOTH THESE FLOPS ON THE SAME NIGHT! HELL, IT WAS I TELL YOU! MY EYES ARE STILL BLEEDING!  SAW ME IN HALF IF I HAVE TO SEE THIS ONE AGAIN!","513":"Cary Elwes doesnt even deserve to be making films - this movie was just terrible and I could not believe how bad the acting was.  The concept was good and in better hands - it couldve been an okay film - but in this case a laughable farce that shouldve gone straight to video.  Definitely deserves to be in a list for the top 10 worst films - it would almost be the top of my list.","514":"The movie starts out kinda good (first 1\/2 hour). Gets lost in the middle with Danny Glover running around for no reason. His character in the movie seemed pointless and reminded me in a small way of Glover in Predator 2 (sweaty and bloody, but not in as good of shape). Anyway, the acting was horrible (Cary was the WORST) and the ending was VERY predictable. If you bought this before DO NOT buy it again! If you didn't buy the first release do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this one either. Severed thumbs way down!!!","515":"This movie is horrible.  Its not even worth 1 star.  This plot is so overused, I mean if you like this at least watch Seven you might view Saw differently, I could tell a couple college kids wrote it in 2 weeks its a simple formula for money which is a big part what the movie industry is about, but comon now.  But I am going to give it a star, not as a horror movie but a comedic attempt at a horror movie, some of the scenes are friggin hillarious in retrospect, recommended for a good laugh.","516":"u offered the saw blood cover with pics and all of it said u had it than sent the one with reg cover dont like the way your company does biz.","517":"The movie was what I expected. I needed to watch it for class, but I'm never wasting my money on Amazon Video again. It froze three or four times through the movie, and the quality of the video was really bad.","518":"I have seen the UK version of this DVD, the quality is terrible, as bad as the oldest VHS, chroma bleed and noise destroyed that DVD.  I can only hope that the US encoders do not use the same ratty old VHS to master from that  the UK people obviously used.  This is complete shame as this is one of  Hoppers' great manic moments, the tension present in the film is ever  present and awesome.  5 stars for the film, none for the UK encoding","519":"Blue Velvet would be an interesting movie if it wasn't so confusing. As I watched it, I couldn't figure out what was going on. The whole plot itself  was a little weak, but the performances of Isabella Rossellini, Dennis  Hopper, and Laura Dern were great. Maybe it's just one of those movies that  you either love or you hate.","520":"There are enough opinons about this movie to make it mandatory viewing for anyone who likes things a bit off center. It has interesting characters and visuals, but is short on plot and acting. Kyle McLachan and the rest of the cast are not very interesting to watch; Dennis Hopper is, but goes over the top to the point where his character is almost comical. Some satire going on here too, which not everybody \"gets.\" Watch it once to see what all the fuss is about, but it's more something to render judgement on than to enjoy.","521":"Some have found this movie to be daringly shocking.  The only shocking thing that I found about this movie is that some many great actors let themselves participate in such a bad movie.  At the start of this pointless film, it seems interesting and full of suspence, but it soon becomes overly melodramatic and the plot becomes boring.  If you like dry, poorly made movies that have no qualities of redemption, this is the movie for you.  If you have any amount of self respect, stay far away from this film.","522":"If your taste runs towards the morose, then David Lynch's &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; is for you.  Unfortunately, there is little in this widely acclaimed film that makes it watchable or enjoyable.  It's a depressing exercise in non-humanity, and is better left on the shelf.  The director shocks us into thinking his characters have a real raison d'etre, when in fact there is little to explain why they behave the way they do.  A waste of talent, time and critical support.","523":"One of the worst movies I ever saw.  Dennis Hopper must have been on drugs to have acted in this movie.  It was crap from beginning to end.","524":"This is a repellent story about an impoverished Victorian entomologist who falls in love with an aristocrat. The only redeeming value of this movie was to depict in what is probably a realistic way the treatment of servants  in that era.","525":"Total waste of time.  Waited for the ending to somehow validate this moronic movie and only got further into that place where you say to yourself \"How did I sit through that whole piece of junk?\"  I'd give it about a -3 if they had minus stars.","526":"Purely a propaganda film and, while beautifully filmed and mostly well acted (with some exceptions among the American characters), doesn't rise above being a propaganda film.","527":"Disjointed movie. Bad Chinese propaganda linking the 1911 revolution for democracy to the 1949 communist revolution that installed a dictator government. Jackie Chan sold out.","528":"I watched the Klansman on my Kindle Fire. I was appalled to discover two first rate actors, Richard Burton and Lee Marvin, as the protagonists. I've seen \"disaster zone\" movies before and I must say that the Klansman makes the top five! The only reason to watch this movie is to see Burton-Marvin \"acting\" as part of a sentimental journey into the past... There's nothing else to recommend this complete failure.","529":"Dire.  By which I mean the DVD which seems to have been authored by someone at home with some free software.  The DVD claims to be 112 minutes long (It says that on the packaging) but it is only 100:35  The other 12 minutes was lost when this was cut into the pan & scan TV movie travesty that you see before you.","530":"I don't know who was more lubed, Marvin or  Burton.  Lola Falana is the victim of a really brutal gang rape, OJ Simpson is whacking people left and right.  Not even bad enough to be funny.  Hard to believe the same man who directed FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was involved.  Save your money.","531":"Yes, The Movie itself is a great work but the picture quality from this Blu Ray Version shows almost no difference from that of DVD. Personally disappointed in this point very much. it doesn't seem to have the remastered process for this blu ray. So Personally <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006YZOXDK\">Hondo [Blu-ray<\/a>]I think it's not necessary to buy this blu ray version expecting better picture quality if you already have the dvd of this movie.","532":"This video is just horrible!  I bought it because my 18 month old loves Elmo.  Elmo is barely in the video!  After 2 minutes, my toddler walked out of the room.  It most definitely did not hold any interest for her.","533":"This video seems much more geared toward older children and adults than the typical Sesame Street age child. The dialouge linking the video segments together does not hold the interest of my 19 month old. The music segments are more interesting to me than they are to her.  It does very little to engage my young viewer. I would suggest Barney, Blues Clues, or Bear in the Big Blue House over this video, especially for the under three crowd.","534":"We were disapointed to see this video had very little of Elmo and a lot of Rosie O'Donnell. It really didn't keep me son's attention - and when Rosie broke into song - my son broke into the other room. His other Sesame Street video Let's Make Music keeps him interested even after 40+ veiwings. Elmopalooza lost his interest the first time he saw it.","535":"After owning\/renting numerous Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, this seemed to be among the more disappointing because:<p>- Elmo barely appears in this video - The artists play\/sing with little interaction with the characters. - Very few songs were catchy and kept my son's attention - Who said that Rosie O'Donnell could sing???<p>This title sounds like a fun video...but it's not.","536":"The songs on this video are entertaining.  But for the parent of an 18-month-old who wants to actually watch Elmo in action, the video is disappointing.  Elmo plays a small role in the video.  It would be great to see much more of Elmo actually singing.","537":"Let me start by saying our son is a big Elmo fan, and we think \"The Best of Elmo\" is tremendous.<p>This DVD starts VERY VERY VERY slowly...and gets worse and worse and worse.  The opening segment takes forever to get through and offers nothing to keep your child's attention or your attention. When the music finally starts, it is disappointing beyond description.  Our son hated it, we hated it, and returned it after 1 abbreviated viewing.  This DVD has nothing to offer for anyone in any age bracket.","538":"Okay, my wife and I couldn't stand it, but my child, who loves Elmo, couldn't sit through it.  Thank heavens for fast-forward.  By the way, who ever told Rosie she could sing?","539":"This video doesn't entertain or captivate my children like the other Elmo videos we love(Best of Elmo, Wild West, and Adv. in Grounchland).  Don't waste your money on this one.","540":"I rented this from the video store and could not believe my eyes when I saw what a poor quality film it was.  It looks like this is home movie shot with one camera because you constantly see the camera shifting from actor to actor.","541":"Take your $27 plus shipping and flush it down the toilet.  Perhaps some good can come from the money that you would have wasted watching this rip off.  I am not quite sure that Strangeheart technically qualifies as a movie per se.  I have yet to see a middle school play that was so poorly crafted, written or acted.  Drunk or not, what a pitiful excuse for a movie.  Find something better to do with your time.","542":"This DVD is an insult to DVD technology. I have never heard such a bad sound, not even on video tapes. The movies worth is at least 50% sound (who ever saw it). Besides the fact that laguage is french (what I oversaw) this  es my worst DVD experience ever. 1 star is too much.","543":"Horrid sound that gets worse as the movie progresses.  I'd read the customer comments and bought it anyway.  The sound is so bad at the end of the film that I had to turn the volume up to 9\/10ths to hear anything at all.  Instead of enjoying the film I was constantly reaching for the volume control.  By far this is the worst transfer of a film to DVD that I've seen\/heard.  If you're thinking of buying, think again or go get a video copy.","544":"A brilliant film, you really should get a copy, but DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! The video is muddy, it reminds me of the Asian Bootlegs shot in theaters by people with cameras hidden in their coats - ironic no?  The sound is beyond description, distorted, muted, flat , just aweful.  Don't waste you time here, move on to one of the higly rated more recent transfers!","545":"When McClintock (my fave Wayne movie, by the way) came out on VHS, there was a big controversy because &quot;Goodtime&quot; video released it in such bad shape. About a week after they released it, John Wayne's son who had produced the movie, said that Goodtime had released it without his permission. He then released a much better version. BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM GOODTIME, ESPECIALLY THIS MOVIE. HOPE THAT WAYNE'S SON WILL RELEASE HIS VERSION ON DVD!!","546":"The DVD is of very low quality due to the use of an old unrepaired master film. It is also in the pan\/scan format for TV. If you want to see this movie in it's best form, watch it on Turner Classic in the cleaned up wide screen format.<p>I give this DVD 2 thumbs down.","547":"The movie is a classic John and Maureen.  The problem is that the transfer appears to have been done in a theatre, with a video camera using a very old print that has been run hundreds of times.  This gives you images with what appear to be tears, burns and other image reducing faults.  I went back to my old VHS copy to see what the real image was supposed to look like. All in all, one of the worst transfers I have ever seen.","548":"Horrible picture on this DVD.  The picture was faded, blurring, and out of  sync!  It was awful! I want to get my money back!  BUT there is good news. Now you can get the official authorized version, which we did, and it's excellent.","549":"I love this move.  In fact, this is probably my favorite JW movie besides &quot;The Cowboys.&quot;  I hate the DVD transfer!  The quality looks like it was recorded straight from the old film reels without any restoration at  all.  I have seen much beter quality versions on tape and even TV.  If you  really want this DVD, then get it because it is fairly cheap, but remember,  you get what you pay for.","550":"The Delta Entertainment DVD is clearly a pirated product and one of the worst film-to-DVD transfers I've ever seen.  At 50 cents a dozen this DVD would still be a waste of money.  Go with the Wayne Estate authorized version.","551":"The Good Times version of McLintock was of atrocious quality. It ruined the entire experience. THis version should not be sold unless there is a disclaimer of the poor quality.","552":"The picture looks like a VHS tape of McLintock if someone taped it on cable in 1987. Terrible picture quality, snowy, blurry, very disappointed","553":"Great Movie but DO NOT BUY this poorly made copy from Hong Kong\/Taiwan. Our bought VHS tape has better picture quality than this DVD version.","554":"McClintock! is an excellent John Wayne Western, lots of laughs, and of course nothing beats the chemistry that John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara bring to the screen.  Sadly however, the quality of this DVD is extremely poor, making it difficult to enjoy.  A VHS copy of a TV airing of McClintock! would be better than what you get on this DVD!  Lots of scratchy sections, poor focus, and audio volume keeps dropping out.","555":"I have the video and the DVD for this movie. My copy of the DVD is horrible. Goodtimes replicated the DVD and it has lines and blurriness throughout. I am a John Wayne fanatic and was very disappointed in the DVD. The video I have is by MPI and it is in much better shape then the DVD. If you plan to buy this movie...WAIT until someone does it right!!","556":"The quality of this addtion is very poor and it is not near as good as the Family autherized copy.  It is not centered right and some seens are out of focus and I was very disappointed.  I have searched for the better copy and have not been able to find it.  If you have a copy please e-mail me thank you (I have a copy on VHS)","557":"This particular product (not the authorized version) of the was a very grainy copy, the copy was blotchy like it had been posterized. Also several scenes are missing.","558":"Goodtimes video has butchered this great movie.  Sometimes the person talking is not in focus or even on the screen.  Some scenes are missing.  I can't take it back for mine was a gift.  Make sure you buy the version authorized by the Wayne estate if you want the real movie with all of the scenes included.  I have that copy on VHS.  Sorry to say I have not yet found it on DVD.","559":"While this is one of my all time favorites I made the mistake of not reading the reviews of the product.  Horrible video transfer.  Stay away, do not buy.","560":"We just got this the other day - really looked forward to watching it. My husband & I are big fans of the movie. It was such a letdown. Our old VHS copy is a better quality than this DVD. We thought that the DVD version would be much clearer and better sound quality. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We're very disappointed, and quite frankly disappointed that Amazon is even selling this DVD. Don't waste your money - worst quality DVD I've ever seen.","561":"This is a terrible DVD.  The company is Goodtimes Home Video.  It was reproduced in Hong Kong or Tiawan.  I'm very disappointed that Amazon.com would be associated with such a piece of junk.","562":"Unfortunatly this DVD is poor quality. The sound track doesn't always match the mouths of actors and there is a shadow or double image particularly in the beginning. I was very disapointed. Thinking of returning this DVD. Bird Lady","563":"Always loved the movie but this recording was cheaply dubbed from a bad vhs tape. There are different versions to buy so save your money and your eyes.","564":"Seriously poor quality.  I \"wish\" I had read the reviews on this product before I ordered it!!  It was as if someone had videoed the movie from a TV screen.  The picture color was poor, the images were \"grainy\", and the film was \"scratchy\".  I loved the movie when it came out, but this was a very poor quality product.  Amazon should take this off their market.  It reflects poorly on them.....","565":"This DVD was of VERY POOR QUALITY. The picture was blury,it had alot of static lines,vertical lines & bad sound. I sent it back for replacement & was sent another one of the same poor quality. All that was done was replacing one bad DVD WITH ANOTHER ONE. I would not recommend this version of McLintock.","566":"This is a horrible copy of the original.  The color is bad throughout the movie.  There are lines in the picture like you would see if you were watching an old home movie.  The widescreen version is much better than this one.","567":"In my minds eye I have retained this film in all its boisterous, hilarious, non-political correct fun! The available copies of this film, however, suck.<p>I will pay $50 for a decent DVD copy of this gem.","568":"Excellent movie, but the quality of the DVD is terrible-very grainy.  It's like they copied a videotape.","569":"If you can find it, get the MPI VHS version of this film. That is the official version from the Wayne estate. It is not wide screen but it has been restored magnificently. Video products from &quot;Goodtimes&quot; have never been known for &quot;good&quot; quality. This film is one of John Wayne's best. Go on a quest. Seek out the MPI version. Good Luck!","570":"I just recieved the DVD and watched it - I DON'T LIKE the picture. The movie itself is great but the quality of the picture and sound is bad. Disappointed!","571":"I watched this movie frequently as a kid and loved it so i decided to buy it, the quality on most of it is good but it seemed like they cut scenes from different versions so some of the picture it poor. i would not recommend this, i would look for a different version like a anniversary copy.","572":"We were disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The picture quality was lousy. In some places it was downright blurry. In this day of computerization, I would think the movie could've been \"updated\" as so many others have been. When our eyes started crossing, we decided to stop watching it. We were sorry we spent our money on it.","573":"A very bad copy for a DVD, my VHS copy is much better. Some scenes are out of focus. Some frames are off center. I'd look for a better edition.","574":"It is a toss-up between &quot;McClintock!&quot; and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; for our all time favorite John Wayne movie, so we were very excited to be able to order them both for our new DVD player.  Re: &quot;McClintock!&quot;  What a disapointment!  The quality (and I use the term loosely) of this DVD, released by &quot;Good Times Video&quot; is horrible.  Wait for an authorized copy, released by the studio!  WE will not buy anything released by Good Times Video again.","575":"The movie is good if not great but the problem was on the GoodTimes video transfer.  The quality of the movie in the transfer was horrible.  At times the picture was ok, but most of the time is was fuzzy and the soundtrack lagged some.  I also have the John Wayne movie &quot;El Dorado&quot; on DVD but not a GoodTimes rendition and the quality of that DVD is excellent.  While I recommend the movie McLintock I do not recommend this GoodTimes version.  Do not waste the money on this one.","576":"The movie is one of my favorites the Duke ever made. I was really excited to see it on DVD. I can't describe my disappointment and frustration as I watched it over Christmas. The recording of the movie was made from a very poor film copy. Many scenes are blurry - totally out of focus. Film scratches are continuous. Don't buy this - wait for someone else to re-master it so it's watchable!","577":"DO NOT waste your money on the DVD of this great movie. Absolutely the worst quality I have ever seen in a DVD transfer. Wait for the wide screen version that, hopefully, will appear soon. The one star is for the quality of the DVD.  The movie itself is a solid 5.","578":"Charles Bronson is realistically nervous taking on NYC's muggers, robbers and assailants after the murder of his wife, but what was once a shocking expose of big city crime and ruthlessness now merely looks ugly and sad, with only detective Vincent Gardenia's pungent asides to give the film a little humanity. Bronson can't seem to go for a walk without a vicious thug picking him out, and while the film isn't very dated, it is over-the-top in its cheap nastiness. The brackish color and dawdling pace are other handicaps that make the whole queasy enterprise slightly stultifying.","579":"Based on the other reviews I expected some great things from this movie. I was very disappointed.  It was more of a comedy version of a horror flick.  It was just so unreal.  The gory parts were realistic, but that was it.  I would not recommend.","580":"I purchased this movie because the reviews say that its better than \"An American Werewolf in Paris\" but I dissagree.  I rather enjoy modern werewolf movies because the special effects make it more realistic, especially when the wolf shape shift's, and attacks.  If you are going to purchase one of these movies I suggest you choose <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/155890848X\">An American Werewolf in Paris<\/a>","581":"...a hundred more times instead of wasting another 90 minutes (or so, it felt like a year!) on this garbage. After watching this \"legend\" of a movie (I have no idea why it is so famous?) I felt confused. Is it supposed to be scary? Or funny? Or both?  \"An american werewolf in London\" was a disappointing movie-experience -not that \"Wolf\" (Nicholson, Pfieffer) was that great either, but it sure is much better than this so-called cult-classic!","582":"I never received this DVD from the seller, despite emailing and requesting the courtesy of a response...I have not received either a response or the movie.  Guess I'm just out $27.00 with no American Werewolf in my collection. Would not recommend doing business here.","583":"I will never buy anything from this company AGAIN! They lied stating the dvd was \"very good condition\" that dvd was not even close to being what they stated, for starters the case where the dvd sits was broken so the dvd just rolls around loose and the dvd itself was scratched real bad!!! I wrote down the companies name so I know who NOT to buy from.","584":"Love this movie so I had to get it on blu ray.  The video quality was avg to sub par and the audio was even worse.  Save yourself the bucks and by the regular DVD and if you have a blu ray player that up-scales you'll probably like it better. Not worth the investment.","585":"This product is available with another name too i.e.  \"Chemistry: Elements, Compounds and Mixtures \" - Search and compare the prices before you choose one","586":"I guess Amazon thought my original review was a little harsh, so I'll try again. PURE GARBAGE MADE BY AN INCOMPENTENT, NO TALENT CHILD WITH A CAMCORDER IN THE MID WEST AND IT ONLY COST $25.00.","587":"This workout has no warmup and no cooldown. It's the worst workout I've ever bought. I actually threw it in the trash.","588":"Yes, The Movie itself is a great work but the picture quality from this Blu Ray Version shows almost no difference from that of DVD. Personally disappointed in this point very much. it doesn't seem to have the remastered process for this blu ray. So Personally <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006YZOXDK\">Hondo [Blu-ray<\/a>]I think it's not necessary to buy this blu ray version expecting better picture quality if you already have the dvd of this movie.","589":"The disks came with a sludge on the read surface that had to be cleaned before the DvDs could be used.","590":"For those of you who are Dean Martin;\/Matt Helm fans, this is the set to pass on.  The movies have been edited for TV and a lot of content has been removed due to subject matter.  There are unedited editions out there and I highly suggest searching for those.  The set is very dissappointing for collectors, it isn't even worth a one star rating.","591":"I read the book first and, as usual, it was not as good as the book.  If you are a Heath Ledger fan or have a background in addiction, you may enjoy the movie but otherwise - there are better movies to spend your money on.  Rent it before you buy it.","592":"I could not make it past the first half hour of it because it was so graphic and seemed to just be going in an endless circle\/cycle! I hated every second of it and should have turned it off way sooner, but I just love Heath Ledger so I tried to get through it. It was awful!!","593":"ANSWER : The Complete title is :  [TEEN ISSUES (PARENTS GUIDE TO GROWING PAINS)]  This is NOT, nor is it based on the Situation Comedy :  \"GROWING PAINS \"!!!","594":"I wanted to get the DVD of \"growing pains\"-a TV show. And when i searched, it showed in AMAZON. So i ordered. But the true name of DVD i got from AMAZON is \"a guide for parents to growing pains\", not the one i wanted. Why the item did not show its true name in AMAZON? It is cheating!","595":"can someone tell us what this is. Is this the first season of growing pains? Or is it something else?","596":"Don't be fooled by shady sellers like Musicisus2001 who won't give refunds. This is really \"A Parent's Guide to Growing Pains.\" Amazon should post a picture of the case to clarify all the confusion.","597":"Purely a propaganda film and, while beautifully filmed and mostly well acted (with some exceptions among the American characters), doesn't rise above being a propaganda film.","598":"Disjointed movie. Bad Chinese propaganda linking the 1911 revolution for democracy to the 1949 communist revolution that installed a dictator government. Jackie Chan sold out.","599":"The theme of this movie is that women should be able to have it all:  to have a career, a home, a husband, and children.  In the 2000's women try to juggle all these things and be Superwomen!  We haven't gained anything in the past 50 years as women, we've just increased our workload!","600":"This movie is really BAD. The acting is horrible and the overall plot is crap. See one of the actresses other movies. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!!","601":"You're not like the lady with the mystic smile Is it only that you're a commie we have blamed you For your anti-traditional viewpoints in your smile<p>Do you smirk at moral values, Kathy Watson? Or is this your way of breaking lonely hearts? Many lies have been brought to our doorsteps They just lie there, and they die there<p>Are they real, are they fake, Kathy Watson? Or just a cold and lonely, hateful piece of art?","602":"This is a story about a girl in an isolated community trying to find her identity in the shadow of her beautiful and much-loved sister.  It was a good thing that I had read the book first because the movie looses much of the story, including the problems with the relationships between Sara Louise, the captain, and her sister. The movie, as usual, changes quite a few important parts of the story, making it a superficial production.  My recommendation - read the book first then get the movie from the local library, don't spend money renting it.","603":"This dvd was nothing like the novel, characters were combine and the story was told out of sequence. It was purchased as a teaching tool to accompany the novel in a special needs class, I was unable to use it for this purpose.","604":"It's an important historical documentary ,  but if you want to see old taps dancers like showed in the dvd cover, avoid it. There are only few short cuts from genius like Bill Robinson and others and many  and many conversations and interviews. Try old videos in VHS or the outstanding afro-american dancers in 'Stormy Weather', a Fox musical from the fourties,  available in Amazon.","605":"Amazon placed this on my recommendations list as \"Kids & Family\".  Umm....I don't think so! unless Amazon recommends people to let their kids watch movies with sex scenes and adult language and situations.  I watched the movie and guess it has a message, but I don't think my kid\/s will be watching this until they are mature enough to handle the sex scenes!","606":"I found this movie to be dragged out and dull. It did the book very little justice, and cut out the best parts! I suggest reading the book instead.","607":"I thought In Her Shoes would be better after watching the trailer and previews for the film.  I found it to be vulgar, boring, and I fell asleep trying to watch it so often, I just took it back to Blockbuster.  Don't waste your time...move is a snore!","608":"I saw this movie on the plane to Europe and to tell you the truth I didn't like it at all. It's a bad story itself, but the actors were horrible. How could Cameron Diaz sleep with her sister's boyfriend? I think it's one of those movies that if you don't see you don't lose anything. It's bad, real bad.","609":"OK, my GF negoiated me into seeing this film.  If you can buy a dinner instead, DO SO!!!  This movie is a strict chick flick - no comedy, no action, boring, slow, all about feelings and relationships between parent and siblings (and in laws).  Plus it is depressing...","610":"If you like the movie, read the book. The movie itself left out a multiple key pieces of the book and drug out altogether too long. I found myself fast forwarding through parts of it just to get the end.","611":"I read this book & it was AWESOME. But, the movie STINKS. I wanted so badly to like it but couldn't no matter how hard I tried. Cameron Diaz is a really bad actress & ruins a lot of movies, but even if there had been a different, more talented actress playing her character this movie would still put you to sleep.","612":"I love that it is about the lives of two sisters, but like I said in my title the movie moves too slow. It's not for me. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.","613":"Like it's previous Stargate, the sound is poorly done.  Which if Amazon had encoded CC wouldn't be a significant issue.  I don't understand why sound people think everything has to scream at you.  Silence is Golden.  Dialogue is what is important, music and sound effects should be in the background where they belong.  It's like having to watch commercials where you always have to mute the screaming idiots!!!!!  Hopefully one day, someone will recognize that when it comes to sound, less is better....","614":"I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.<p>The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film.","615":"Worst video ever!!!!!  Don't waste your money.  Poor poor video quality,  people walk in front of the camera shots.  The video has bird, frog and other various sounds that have nothing to do with the bird or animal on the poor quality video.  You won't like it, your cat won't like it, and that is an understatement.","616":"what an absurd title for this set. black oil. as opposed to what? white oil? pink oil? i certainly hope that they dont expect to sell this set to anyone other than established fans. because i would scoff & giggle at the redundant title. its a glaring reminder of the 'cheese factor' that seemed to bubble up to the surface sometimes during the shows run. whats next: 'xfiles: evil twins & amnesia'?","617":"Maybe it's for people in the dance world. Didn't understand it for some reason. Just didn't get it. Don't know.....","618":"I thought this sounded like an okay film from the synopsis, so I gave it a try.  Found it to be very boring.  Not much holds it together and nothing about it sustained my interest.  A real waste of time.","619":"I've tried it in my DVD player, my laptop (bought about a year ago), my Xbox 360 slim, and another DVD player.  Returning this.  I really wanted to watch Emma Watson.  :[","620":"Can't stand it- don't want it. PLEASE remove from my recommendation list!!<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0012Q3SYG\">The Tomorrow Show With Tom Snyder<\/a>","621":"We bought this video along with the Elmo Potty video and hands down the Elmo one was more engaging and interesting than this video. As we were playing this we both looked at each other and said, this is terrible. Maybe this would be better for older kids 4-5 who are still having problems, our 2 year old was totally not interested in watching this video, we were able to do away with diapers in one weekend mainly with the Elmo video, I would not recommend to anyone, the Elmo however I would recommend.","622":"Even though it shows boys in the video I feel it is more for a girl especially with a princess in the end.  Don't waste your money if your looking for a video for a boy.  My son kinda liked it but then lost interest when the princess came.","623":"My 3 year old son is not at all interested in this video.  The singing is a little annoying.  The skit about a princess and the potty is amateurish and a diversion from the issue at hand.","624":"The language tht they use in this DVD I feel is offensive and demeaning to children.  \"Only babies to do this, only babies do that!\"  You don't need to be negative to potty train a child.  Also, there are no doctors or psychologists that recommend it. I would not get it for anyone.","625":"It's only a half hour long, and it's really amatuerish looking. My 2 year olds couldn't even sit through one viewing.","626":"I purchased this item after reading reviews. Unfortunately the one I received is damaged and will not work. Therefore I give it one star since I have to select a star rating. Would not recommend purchasing this product.","627":"We thought getting this would be a great aid in helping our son get interested in being potty trained but when we played it he completely lost interest in it quickly.  I think it was too bland.  It wasn't colorful, the music or storytelling didn't catch his attention at all.  I truly hope its works for someone else but it didn't for us.","628":"..also, probably for aolder kids, closer to 3. my daughter is 18months old and gets scared watching this video. she is not scared of her potty or her potty books, so it must be the video.","629":"Even though this item isnt that expensive, it is totally not worth the money. First the video seems to be only good for kids 3 over. So if your kid is 3 or over and still not potty trainned, then it is a good video, yet annoying and not that fun. My son is 2 he watched for two seconds and was not interested at all and he loves watching videos. It is not that easy for little toddlers to understand and get what they need from the video. There are better potty trainning movies out there.","630":"Could be a matter of personal taste, but my 2-year-old daughter was not impressed with this video - she was much more responsive to Elmo's Potty Time. The story is cute and the young woman is friendly enough, but my daughter was bored 10 minutes into it and left the room.","631":"My son was completely bored within minutes of watching the DVD. I was bored, but it's not meant for me. Didn't motivate him. Didn't do anything at all in regard to the potty. He asked me to turn off the DVD. I'll stick with our Elmo Potty Time DVD. He loves that one. I just thought another DVD with kids using the potty would help more so. Waste of money! Plus, I bought it based upon the reviews. Now I'm hesitate in buying something with such good reviews. This is a bad potty DVD!!!","632":"My son didn't want to watch the show and the songs didn't get him interested, but since I did pay $12 for it I will try again in a month.","633":"It's a fairly cute movie but my kids didn't seem too interested. I think maybe one reason is it's based on a princess and I have boys. Two my children seem to be more intrigued with a cartoon rather than actual people.","634":"If I did not sit there with him for the whole 2 minutes he would have left the room. Really really cheesy, not entertaining, annoying to the parent, and well my son would have rather played in dirt.","635":"This is not a really high quality production.  Looks like it was shot by a company that maybe also does wedding videos.  My 18 month old son walked away from it and brought me a Sesame Street dvd to put on.  I'm hoping the Elmo Potty training video that should be out soon is more entertaining for him.  I really couldn't watch this one more than once.","636":"It should be called \"Sleepy Power\"...my 2 yr old was bored right to sleep. He will not sit and watch this video. VERY disappointing!!!","637":"DVD has two big flaws: telling toddlers that may still be in a crib that only babies sleep in cribs (I'm quite happy my 2 1\/2 yr old is still in a crib and so is she) and the CREEPY JESTER. The part at the end where it says, \"he asked the princess when they were finally alone why she finally went on the potty\" is just wrong. Plus, his horrible singing and joking for the parents is useless for kids and annoying for adults. Who on earth thought this creepy hack should be in a kid's DVD?","638":"This DVD will only work if you child is at the age where he\/she wants to be a big kid. Since my child is only 2 and still thinks that she is a baby, it didn't do anything to her. I would not recommend this if you want to train your child while he\/she is still small.","639":"My boys were not interested in this movie at all.  Unfortunately I don't recommend this movie for potty training.","640":"This didn't work for us and was not very exciting. This features a much older crowd where are the two year olds? They all appear to be about kindergarten and that is a bit old for potty training these days.","641":"We were very disappointed with this video.  It is billed as a training video, but it was more like a basement recording of the same song.  It didn't hold our son's attention, and we would not recommend it.","642":"This video is very poorly made. Production quality is terrible even for a children's video. My kid gets very bored with this DVD. How can it inspire when it can't even hold the kid's attention. Not worth the money. Rent it on Netflix instead of buying it.","643":"The only thing this will teach your child is how to wash your hands for 20 seconds. The video tells you how poop and potty is made, ( my kids where like???) Then it tells you you don't need diapers anymore and sings a ridiculous song. Then tells you when your done tell your mom to flush and wash your hands for 20 seconds. Doesn't teach you at all to tell your parents you have to go potty, or how to go potty. Waste of money.","644":"After watching Elmo's Potty Time for the last few weeks, Potty Power's low-quality production was hard to bear.","645":"Had high hopes for this one, but it did not hold any interest for my 18 month or 2-1\/2 year old grand children.  They watched it once, and didn't seem to get into it at all; and it certainly didn't inspire them to use the potty.","646":"I have 2 y.o. twins.  They could have cared less.  The kids in the DVD are older kids, which doesn't help at all.  The singing didn't keep their attention, nor did the entire DVD.  I hope I can find a better one.","647":"I got it, but after watching it realized, it is not really necessary... it does show some \"big kids\" on the potty, but the quiz is probably more geared up towards 3years old-somethings... my son is 20 months and he still sleeps in his crib etc...and the message was not very clear- I'd prefer step-by-step instructions... the princess story is not necessary I agree, won't even let my boy watch it- he is no princess for sure.. I wish I did not buy it- not necessary, really...","648":"I ordered the Potty Power dvd on April 28th. They said it would arrive no later than May 20...well by the 27th, I decided to contact them. No answer back (via email). I was refunded by Amazon. Really disappointed b\/c this was a gift that never came and NO ONE contacted me about this!!","649":"In this film 5 super heros have magical rings, that when the powers are combined form Captain Dump. They are 1. Corn 2. Peanuts 3. Pinworm 4. Spinach, and 5. Cheerios. With you powers combined I am Captain Dump! (All 5 in unison)Go Dump!  Great film.","650":"Our two-year old watched it for the first time last night and was literally pooping in her diaper as she watched.  Seems to  have missed the point on the initial attempt.  She did ask to watch it again when it ended.  At least it was entertaining to her.","651":"Looked in good condition but on four scenes the DVD stalled  or the picture broke up which frustrated us and our child while we were viewing the tape.....in future will not buy DVD's that are used........","652":"First of all, this video is only about 25 minutes long, so there's not a lot of room for content.  I bought this for my 2.5 year-old son, and we were all disappointed.  The \"Princess and the Potty\" story held NO interest for him at all, so the video is even shorter in our house.  Also, there's no discussion about accidents, boys standing to pee, or other issues that need to be covered for training.  If you have a boy, I suggest thinking about a different video, such as \"It's Potty Time!\" or the Elmo potty video.","653":"My girlfriend just had to see this movie. I rarely see her disapointed in something we watch, but this one really sucked.","654":"It was pretty boring really... Not much of a plot.. nothing new as far as the resident evil creepies are conserned, no crazy lake monster or anything neat. I miss the old RE with the walking dead, not thies plant a seed head pop off wigglie things. The series has taken a turn for the worse, its time to get back to bacis and get some creative ideas going.","655":"The CG is great and the movie is awful. Not a god story at all, really really bad.  Why can't someone make a good CG movie...","656":"Futuristic sci-fi actioner details an attempt to break into New York City, now a gigantic prison, to get the United States president out.  The film gets a boost from such an intriguing premise and a highly enjoyable performance from Kurt Russell, but the action scenes completely lack in energy, lots of potential is wasted, and New York looks pretty much like any other urban neighborhood.  I'm a fan of John Carpenter, but I can't defend his work here.  Followed by a fairly ridiculous but enjoyable sequel.","657":"Read the reviews at amazon.co.uk. It is upscaled standard definition. It looks like garbage. Don't waste your money, just wait for the official US release which will hopefully be better.","658":"ahh ooohh!!!  boo!!! so boring i napped during it got this one for $5 and still felt robbed a class actors in a remake that sucks---- i got it sit on ur hand and thats the perfect stranger!!!!","659":"This movie tries way too hard.  It is such a struggle to be suspenseful, but it never quite makes it. Willis' character is boring.  The dialogue is not very interesting.  I think this is the most I have ever heard Berry say the F-word.  Wow.  DOn't waste your money on this one.","660":"toss every bad idea in a hat,shake it,start grabbing and you can make perfect stranger part 2.  there will be a mighty war between this crap and that lilo p\/o\/s ''i know who killed me'' for worst movie of this decade.","661":"That is the \"twist\" at the end and trust me, it is not worth the wait! Shame on James Foley and crew for this POS - should have simply gone straight to DVD and then forgotten. Talk about a waste of talent and energy - including my (and hopefuuly not your) time to watch it!","662":"I was really enjoying this movie until the end, when everything was beginning to unfold. Let just say the end was sooo stupid, it ruined the whole movie (whoever came up with such a Bad ending should be fired!)","663":"Save your money. Halle Berry again proves that she sucks and that she is a bad actress. She also proves that she again cannot pick a good movie to 'star' in. Looks only take you so far and that is something that Hollywood has yet to learn about this 'Oscar winner' (what a joke!)  The story is horrible and stupid all at the same time.","664":"GET A NEW AGENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  while her acting wasnt deplorable,the movie was a perfectly convoluted mess.so much to say about a movie with absolutely nothing to say leaves me at a loss........this is only for those who are eager to see halle regardless of the turd shes in.  how long before halle,j-lo and sandra bullochs star in the same movie ?!?!?!?!?!?","665":"Halle Berry and Bruce Willis can't save this boring thriller in which a investigative reporter(Halle) tries to catch the supposed killer(Bruce) of her friend with the help of a computer spec(Giovanni Ribisi). I won't get into details because I don't want to spoil the pleasure for those who will see the movie. No thrill, no suspense,a weak plot, too many computer details,worth seeing only for Giovanni Ribisi(in case you're not a fan of Halle). Better to leave it a \"Perfect Stranger\".","666":"'Perfect Stranger' starts out promising, but quickly begins to meander and become routine. This isn't helped by the lackluster performances by Berry, Willis and Ribisi who I usually love to watch. The film has a good start and a good ending which makes it watch-able, but in the middle there is too much filler and not enough meat! I rated it 2 1\/2 stars 2 for the film and another 1\/2 for a good ending. Rent it.....don't buy it!","667":"Could have been good, with a little imagination.  No suspense.  Dull.  Ending was lame.","668":"Not nearly the movie I thought it was going to be. It seemed to me a big foiled mess that the writer's tried to make sense of in the end but it just didn't wash. Totally unbelievable and down right messy film.","669":"The movie could be called \"PERFECT FLAWED\". What a bad thriller this was... Another bad choice by Berry and Willis is probably smiling inside, working just for the paycheck. A really bad movie, one of the worst of the year. Maybe Berry wnats another Razzle.","670":"I have to say...this movie is the worst movie that I have seen so far this year!!!  Bruce Willis was okay in it but Halle Berry was the serial killer??? Everything..EVERYTHING pointed to Bruce Willis as the murderer and then Halle's friend \"finally\" figures out that it was her that was killing everyone because she had buried her dad several years ago. STUPID MOVIE!!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!","671":"After watching the movie, you dislike every character. Really a very difficult movie to get through, even though the producers try to entice you with provocative shots of Berry and the hope of seeing Bruce Willis, whose total on-screen time amounts to a cameo.  To Berry: really stupid hat To Ribisi: great potential wasted here To Bruce: dissapionted you showed up in this one To potential audience: boring, dizzy, with a dash of anti-America messages","672":"After I read the reviews on amazon, I decided this movie would be a good film to buy.  Mistake!  I honestly would rank this a B class film because of the bad acting, dialog, and editing.  There is some good songs in the film but that is about it.  Overall, a big disappointment save your money.  It is hardly even worth watching.","673":"Porn star is the girl next door, as it turns out.  This movie sells for the same reason that the girls who tease get what they want.  While there is some humor to this story, that's about all that I can say that is good about this film.","674":"Movie was drivel but there were some excellent songs particularly David Gray's This Years Love that i was introduced to. I'm definately checking out his CD's and there were some other good songs as well. I've already totally forgotten about the movie but that song is lingering in my head.","675":"I found this movie to be highly offensive and tasteless.  Something's wrong with Hollywood when it produces movies where teenage boys get lap dances.","676":"This movie had such potential,  and unfortunately it didn't even come close to reaching the outer fringes of it.  Not funny,  at any point. I didn't even crack a smile, actually I never even smirked.  I was expecting so much more.  One positive...great soundtrack.  Otherwise this movie is a complete throw-away!","677":"It was a while ago, but somebody came up with a painting that contained everything Americans like about art.  The painting, as you would expect, is horrid (i.e. animals, little kids, sunsets, etc. all thrown into a jumble.) Well, this movie is just like that painting.  It's got all the stuff folks are supposed to like about teen movies, but it's an incoherent, idiotic mess full of horribly, uninteresting and cliched characters.  Go watch Risky Business, even it's for the tenth time.","678":"C,mon. im fed up of these Teen Comedies. always about 'Oh I cant wait to have sex, I will do it today'. BASICly this film is for Boys that have never been wid a girl in their lives. The actors friend in the film goes @have sex with her for me please@ wots dat all abot. PERVERTISM. But then again its kinda funny","679":"...this movie is really awful. Don't watch it. People who give it a 5\/5 rate must be paid for it by the director. Sorry, the acting and the plot are simply bad.","680":"There's nothing in the \"unrated\" version to justify the salacious marketing on its cover. The movie itself is far less substantial than it should be, as well.","681":"Why did they produce such a cheap transfer?  There is some artifacting, the blacks are not solid, there's lots of edge enhancement, but most of all, it's full frame!","682":"Seller had DVD listed as \"mint condition\", this was not the case. I was embarrassed giving this scratched up disc as a gift!!!!","683":"Ok, so this item was rated \"very good,\" and that was not necessarily the case.  So far, the video itself has played ok, but the VHS cartridge was in poor shape, and the box was cracked and in quite poor shape.  Not quite \"very good\" if you ask me, as the product that is shipped is more than just the VHS, it is the whole presentation.","684":"Received Cinderella and was delighted and after it played 3 times, it now has stops in it and there is no apparent scratch to make this happen. Not sure why, but disappointed for my grand daughter.","685":"I ordered this DVD thinking it was new. It is not. Disc 1 is completely scratched all over. The movie skips periodically throughout the movie. Will not purchase from this seller again!","686":"I ordered this movie for my child for Easter.  It plays just fine on our new DVD player, but our older DVD player won't recognize it at all and neither will our computer.","687":"Was dissappointed with the condition of the Dvd, there are scratches on both Dvds and the spindle is broke on one side of the case, therefore the Dvd was loose in the case.","688":"Not the best DVD (difficulty with formatting, and subtitles displaying). Also, has some skipping.  I will keep shopping for a better version of this DVD.","689":"Very unhappy with the quality of this product. It looks like someone copied the DVD and the outer sleeve on the case. Low quality copy even.  If you are going to forge a DVD, don't charge $20- something for it.  I am very disappointed and will be sure to never buy from this seller again.","690":"My order was sent as a gift to my great-granddaughter, it arrived and the feature DVD of Cinderella was defective and unable to play.  My grandson has written you about this and we have not received any satisfaction as of today.  The extra video played just fine but the main gift item was the DVD of Cinderella.  We are hoping for a refund from your company as Soffo is not responding.  Betty Shaw","691":"The package as received looked like new, like original packing.  However, after opening, one of the two discs didn't play normally in the DVD player.  The picture and sound was intermittent and jerked all the time.  I am afraid to order a used item from now on.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0007Z9R7A\">Cinderella (Two-Disc Special Edition)<\/a>","692":"I ordered 2 copies of Cinderella and received only 1.  They were to be sent by 2 different suppliers, but I have yet to hear from the one not delivered.  Joanne Achen","693":"I ordered and paid for this in November and never received it.  I contacted the seller who said to give him 48 hours to find a solution.  That was the last I heard for him because he never responded to my numerous emails.  Now a little girl did not get her special present and I have to dispute this purchase with my credit card.","694":"Whom ever copied this movie did a terrible job.  This movie is not an original copy from Disney.  When I took this dvd and compared it to all of my other Disney movies there are some distinct differences.  The worst part of it is that all the movie does is skip from the beginning to the end.  So I paid for a movie that cannot even be viewed, it stops throughout the entire movie, no matter the dvd player.","695":"The condition posted was \"Used, Very Good.\" The movie was to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. The box was broken, cracked and yellow. It was in such bad condition that I couldn't send it to her. I would like to have had the condition of the box reported.","696":"The Cinderella DVD we received played well till the very end. It froze and would not continue. It was a gift for my granddaughter and she was so upset not to be able to see the end. This DVD was played on a new disc player so we know it was the DVD and not the machine.This was the first time we viewed the movie and could not believe it was damaged. It arrived on time and in a sealed package. The envelope was not damaged during shipping.I won't be ordering another used item.","697":"Unfortunatly, I placed this order with Amazon in the hopes I would receive 2 copies of Cinderella. I ordered and was charged for 2 movies, but so far I have only received 1. I am highly unlikely to ever do this again and I am very sad because so far, I have been cheated out of 23.90.","698":"Purchased this for my granddaughter's birthday and ordered before Christmas.  It took a long time to be delivered, but it came in time and appeared to be new as advertised.  When opened, it was dirty and scratched like someone had tried to \"clean\" it.  The seller couldn't be contacted because they had quit selling on Amazon.  Just there to rip people off for the holidays, I guess.  Amazon was great though - they have taken care of my problem.  I will still buy from Amazon - but NOT from this seller, should they return to selling.","699":"I would love to write a review  on the movie but I never got the movie and it's been over a month since I ordered it. Wait it gets better, I even sent two emails to the seller and they haven't wrote back. I wish Amazon would help me get my movie that  I ordered and paid for. I check everyday to see if he shipped it on my order details and it always says that he shipped it. I hope Amazon helps me get my order so they don't loose a customer over a dump seller.","700":"I purchased two DVDs from different sellers and never received my copy from this Seller","701":"The disc we received is a pirate version of the original. The contents of the DVD's play ok on the player, but you can easily tell they aren't the originals.","702":"I ordered a new copy of Cinderella DVD and received a scratched up DVD obviously it was not new !!!!!","703":"When I received the dvd I noticed the the art work for the cover was a copy and the dvd itself I believe is a copy too there are some wierd glitches while watching the movie. The printing on the dvd is off center, the case on the inside that holds the dvd was also damaged. I do not believe that the seller should have listed this as an original disney dvd.","704":"Please review your records and you will see I filed a claim because Seller called Double J 2010, took my money and ran!  I am hoping Amazon.com will resolve this swiftly and refund my money.  Based on four recent reviews of this seller, every one claimed their products were never received, imagine that!! I strongly suggest you remove this seller or do a more thorough background check on those that permit to sell on your site.  Thank you!  Kathy","705":"I am not sure how it may have happened but I placed the order over 2 months ago I believe and have yet to recieve the product... I would like something to be done about this issue since the transaction has already withdrawn from my bank account","706":"I would like to receive the movie and then I can properly comment on it.","707":"Disc was delivered to me with a defect. It skips when we get to the same spot everytime. Very disappointed.","708":"I couldn't wait to receive the Cinderella movie. I knew my 3 year old twin girls would love it! I was very disappointed when we started watching it and it skipped. I was hoping that it was just one time. Well, it wasn't. It skipped through the entire first half of the movie and then it finally stopped and had a black screen.","709":"Was told by Disney this is NOT an authorized product of Disney! Main DVD will NOT play on my DVD player (only on my PC). Received NO response from distributor for refund & return policy after two e-mail requests. BAD PURCHASE!","710":"This item was ordered two months ago but has never been received. I have tried to contact the seller but no success. I didn't take the time to read the reviews of this seller prior to ordering but wish I had. They were almost all bad.","711":"If you are looking for cinderella with the slip cover limited case it will not come with it. it is only the dvd case, the slip cover and everything in the pictures is NOT included. Don't be fooled by this FALSE ADVERTISING.","712":"I wish I would have been more diligent in reading reviews prior to buying from this individual.  Not following through and sending purchased items seems to be a standard practice based on other reviews. Amazon continuing a relationship based on this poor practice doesn't put them a good light.  My grand daughter is the one losing out as Cinderella is her new favorite.  I will make that right by dealing with someone else more trustworthy.","713":"I ordered a movie from this company and it has been almost a month, and I have yet to receive it. I emailed them with an inquiry ten days ago, and never got a response. There is no way to track my order, and I cannot reach anyone by phone! I would not do business with these people!","714":"I got a bootleg DVD of the Disney Cinderella movie. I know because there are a bunch of typos on the DVD guide, but otherwise I was almost completely foolded. I am reporting this to the AMAZON.com customer service.","715":"Terrible service!!! Took to long to get. Then shipper sent wrong DVD.  Tried to contact them and there email was full. So I guess o stuck with the wrong item","716":"I ordered this for my great grandaughters Birthday. After several weeks I contacted shipper. First he said it had been mailed. Then he said thay had no more to ship!! VERY DISAPOINTING!","717":"i received a wierd email about my package and when I went to send the seller an email about it, it said they cancelled their acct with amazon ! we just called the credit card company an had them stop payment","718":"I ordered a DVD for a gift and didn't open the movie until after 30 days from the time of order.  The DVD was defective and asked for a replacement and they didn't have the same movie.  In the future I will play the movie as soon as I get it.  I have never had this happen before.","719":"After ordering on 11\/19 I am still waiting for it to be delivered!! In the future and item should not be sold if it can't be delivered in a timely fashion!!","720":"I thought this movie was going to be \"New\" and in great shape, however it looks old and the case was even broken.  :(","721":"ordered this item on August 4th. Estimated delivery was August 11-26th. Still havent recieved it.","722":"Received defective Cinderella DVD....video distorted, lines on the screen, DVD skips, etc  Needs to be returned......poor response time since my request","723":"How do I rate a product I did not receive?  German Food Store LLC charged my credit card and never sent the DVD.","724":"Movie never came. Tried to contact seller twice! No response...Never recieved item...Never will buy from again!","725":"Contacted seller that I did not receive DVD and have received no response from seller. I have filed a claim with Amazon.","726":"The delivery was VERY fast. We got the DVD about a week before they expected. However, it was NOT \"new\". There were no security sealings on the case which leads me to assume that it was opened. The wrapping on the case was not the original wrapping that comes on DVDs. It was a shrink wrap just like the kind we use at our college bookstore to wrap bundled textbooks. THEN, when we watched the movie, it was scratched. This was NOT a satisfying purchase. Be VERY careful when ordering this DVD.","727":"Pre-ordered this movie for my daughter.  Loaded the digital copy to the iPad and when my daughter got home we put the blu-ray it.  It has side bars and you have to format your wide screen tv to stretch the picture and remove them.  Who makes a dvd in that format these days?  All other disney blu-rays I have purchased are in widescreen format.  It is 2012.  Aspect ration is 1:33:1 whatever that means.","728":"I remember watching this as a child in the 70's and feeling a bit board...now as an adult I don't think the message is very healthy! Cinderella gives children the harmful impression that \"it pays to be pretty.\"  I don't think there are any positive messages in this film for young girls.  I would recommend that you go out and rent Shrek instead.","729":"I cannot think a film is decent if it makes the good-looking people morally \"correct\" and the unattractive people villains.  There are many people who look lovely on the outside and are hideous on the inside.  Just as some of the most conventionally unappealing people have the purest most beautiful hearts.  This film sends the wrong message.","730":"I haven't seen the movie in a long time, and i was excited to watch the movie, so i put it in the VHS player, and it wouldn't play, i tried putting in a different movie to see if it was the player but it was perfectly fine, so i hated this and i was mad and almost cried.","731":"purchased dvd because brother in laws house in NZ used in movie. good movie. happy with promptness of arrival from the US to NZ . dvd in excellent condition.","732":"This movie was superficial.  I did not find the characters interesting or an any way real.  If it was ment to be funny, it missed the boat!","733":"The movie became a cartoon of martial arts fighting. It was a total joke. The movie started out for the first few minutes with a silent sound track. It should have stayed silent.","734":"I bought this video with the idea of sharing this movie with other's in our church.The couple I wanted to see this movie could not get it to run.  I had rented this movie and loved it enough to buy it. I did not check it out before giving it out. The movie was great for me. Since discovering Bruce Marchiano and the many things he has written and filmed has touched me and causes me to think more about the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.","735":"I appreciate the effort that went into making this film. The acting was not as good as other Christian films. It just didn't measure up to my expectations. The story line was not very strong either, though it did have some good moments.","736":"Weak at points, poor portrayals of characters, inaccurate and can be annoyng if you have read the Bible. Why is it so difficult for contemporary directors to follow the story line?","737":"They have gone to far with creative ability....making stuff up,  we watched it for an hour subsequently it went into the garbage.","738":"A real waste of time. The book was excellant and I could hardly put it down. I could hardly tell this was supposed to be based on the book. The worst movie I've seen since Showgirls way back when. If you would like a free copy of this movie look in my garbage can.","739":"Initially I came away from the film thinking this is perhaps an apology for the concern the Church had over the first film.  However, in my contemplation, I became awkwardly curious why all of this star power tainted themselves in a Porky's II attempt at duplicating a movie that had conclusion.  Money is the only reason I can deduce. In the competitive Hollywood game of diving for pearls, Angels and Demons found empty shells.","740":"An unimaginative script, lots of running about but no real suspense. Cant find other words than \"boilerplate\" and  \"boring\". Fake pretentious unimaginative drama. Like \"The Code.\" i like history like the next guy but this...this, this was indigestible junk movie-food, unprofessional scriptwriting and film making.  and awful casting. Hanks was totally off, the physicist character undeveloped. the cardinals weren't bad, tho'  there was the beautiful backdrop of a virtual Vatican.  music, by Hans Zimmer, was predictably good, probably the best part of the whole thing.","741":"The blu ray played great. I'm not a blu ray fan. Have a lot of bad experiences with them not playing right. The movie is good. It has a good story to it. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy it. Special because it keeps your brain working.  But it's not for me. I'm not a bright person and this movie puts me to sleep. I have this movie added to my collection because my husband likes it.","742":"Other reviewers have adequately commented on the motion picture itself.  This review pertains to the so-called Two-Disc Extended Edition.  While most two-disc editions provide the viewer with hours of additional features on the making the motion picture and the cast and crew, this edition provides the viewer with only three ten-minute featurettes, that easily could have been included on the feature disc, and about 20 \"previews\" for other motion pictures.  At typically a 50% premium in price over the single-disc version, the three featurettes are not worth the price.  Buy the single-disc version instead and enjoy the movie.","743":"Not that the first film was a classic or anything, but it was still mildly interesting. This film begins well, but then devolves into a ridiculous pseudo-mystery and becomes tedious as it goes on.  This is Ron Howard and Tom Hanks in need of a hefty paycheck, and nothing more. Hanks' Langdon is a bore, devoid of any detectable human emotion.  This franchise needs to end.","744":"The price and packaging were great. As far as the movie..Well it's a personal opinion but I thought it was terrible.","745":"Although I enjoyed the movie (the real crux of this review, right?), for my collection I'm only trying to buy blu-rays that come with digital copies. I was disappointed when I received my A&D blu that the digital copy code HAD AN EXPIRATION DATE and it was already expired! I hadn't seen this before, but was thoroughly upset that something that is advertised to come with the movie had an expiration date? That is ridiculous. I'm pretty upset that Amazon didn't fully disclose on the discs page, I wouldn't have bought it then. BUYER BEWARE!!!","746":"I liked the movie.  However, I was unable to appreciate it as it left the book too far behind.  Too many missing characters and plot deviations.","747":"Brown has time and again attempted to pass the historical references in his stories as fact; however, once again we have a story from Brown that is full of historical inaccuracies.  All you have to do is just a tiny bit of research to pick most of them out.  So, if you like fictional stories that claim historical accuracy when they are not accurate at all, then this is for you.","748":"This is a bunch of BULL! How can you explain leaving out THE MAIN VILLIAN OF THE BOOK!? That's like leaving out Lex Luthor of a Superman comic, Joker from Batman etc, how do you leave out the villian of the novel when it's the villian that has a vendetta with the church that's displayed in the movie!? The \"hashassin\" of the movie was just a sideshow character no where near the importance that's giving to him in the book, this movie was made strickly to please hollywood and the church.","749":"I purchased this video as a \"USED - LIKE NEW\" video.  To my surprise, when it arrived it was nothing but a copy of the original. If I wanted to buy an illegal copy I would have talked to my IT man at work.","750":"Though the DVD plays fine, the inside of the case had what looks like pop spilled and dried in it and the outside of the case (and paper description) is damaged (paper torn, wrinkled and maybe rerolled flat to put back in plastic).  I didn't even want to touch the case with a bare hand until I wiped it off with a clorox wipe!","751":"Not a complete disaster, but loses the dynamic feel of the book. Many of the details are changed including some major plot points and for no apparent reason other than to shorten the movie. The progression of the clues moves in a paint-by-numbers fashion.  I was looking forward to the movie and had high expectations given the director and actors. Very dissapointed.","752":"This is a really bad movie. Even worse than The Da Vinci Code. Why can't we learn in America that less is more? Each sequence is more unbelievable than the last, as if audiences will only be satisfied with even more special effects and even more gore. A totally predictable \"twist\" as an ending as well. Forget it. And for those who say read the Dan Brown books instead, you can go one better: read Holy Blood, Holy Grail.","753":"It is not that often I feel my IQ level goes down after watching a movie, but I think we are talking at least 3 points here.  This movie is utter crap.","754":"My rating is not because of the movie, I really, really liked the movie (I never read the book). It's incredible that with 40 GB of capacity in blu-ray discs the studios won't consider the spanish spoken customers and give them at least spanish subtitles. This Blu-ray disc, along with The Da Vinci Code (Extended Cut) and District 9 have the same problem. Every customer that buys a Blu-ray disc should receive ALL the possible information, extras, interviews, documentaries, trailers, EVERYTHING!!! about the movie that is buying (and that includes subtitles .... that's my opinion).","755":"The main characters are egotistical, the story is totally implausible, and the script is focused on little more than stomping the Catholic Church. This film consists of a mis-match of boring clues followed by chases and running to the next boring clue.  This is not my favorite movie. I dumped it after 45 minutes.  Rent something else this time.","756":"Maybe they should have read the book before they made the movie! The book is great but the movie doesn't hold true to the book at all and was very disappointing.","757":"The CD I received (Angel and Demons) would not play through.  It kept freezing on frames early into the movie.","758":"This movie produced by those who brainwash us out in Hollywood, directed by the loser Ron Howard, starring the no talent Tomy Hanks, both involved with the globalist movement of the Illuminati.. telling people that the Illuminati is a thing of the ancient past as it NOW works to destroy humanity by way of collapsing economies.. This movie was NOT at all about the Illuminati.","759":"This is a horrible movie.  Made by atheists for atheists. Steer clear if you are a Christian.","760":"I loved the book, it had so many twists and turns. Then I watched the movie and it didn't follow the book at ALL. They didn't even put some of the main characters in the movie. Things just didn't line up. If I never read the book I might have liked the movie, but from the stand point of someone who thinks that a movie should follow the book as close as possible, this movie was a huge disappointment.","761":"Another example of Book-Movie adaption gone completely wrong. I expect there to be some liberties taken, I am not naive. But, there were so many! As I watched I felt like, \"Did I read the book?\", because so many things that I thought were key in the novel had been changed. Hollywood needs to stop messing with good stories! I may think twice before I see another Book-Movie adaption.","762":"this was a terrible movie.  admittedly, i can't tell if my disdain comes from having read the book first or not.  i don't even think this is worth renting for 3.99.","763":"Just being about the vibe of the movie - I expected more after all the great reviews and the hype.  It was just an ok movie.  Not too boring, but not enough action and suspense.  I just didn't get a feel of excitement from it.","764":"If you've ever read the book.  Please don't waste your time or money on this DVD.  They changed the story dramatically it was not very good at all.  I was very disappointed by the movie.  I understand things need to be changed for film but they changed some very strange things that just ruined it!","765":"I read the book and this movie did not justice to it at all. I watched it with my wife, who had not read the book, and I had to pause every 5 minutes to explain for 10 minutes. It too rushed and took the beauty of the story away.","766":"this movie is about the opposite of Run Lola Run.  It features not only some of the worst, most amatuer attempts at symbolism you will ever see, but also a very disgusting tracheotomy scene, a kid eating glass and so much more (maybe even incest!) all done rather realistically.  Really, this movie repulses me.  I wanted to like it, but... I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) only because it at least tried to be interesting (though it fails miserably) and even that is something compared to most American movies.","767":"The Exterminator was one of my favourite 80s revenge films. Violent & gritty, a no holds barred hedonistic delight. The DVD release, however, sucks. There were some pretty realistic effects for its day, but these have been heavily edited and it shows. I wish I'd know this before I wasted my money on an inferior DVD release. Don't make the same mistake!","768":"The movie was just ok. It apparently received nominations for awards but I have to admit that I caught myself yawning a few times during the movie.","769":"I learned long ago that Academy Awards earned are not a good indicator of whether or not a movie is entertaining. Maybe this film is supposed to make you think, but all I could think about were things like \"I wonder if anything will ever happen\", and \"is this thing almost over?\" I will admit that the acting was superb, but wasted on this material.","770":"I really did not care for this movie....just wasn't what I expected...it was ok...my husbnad liked it more then me but he even said it was just ok...sorry won't watch this again...donated it already!!!","771":"I know this movie is supposed to be about subtlety, and how paranoia can overtake someone's mind, and I appreciate those aspects of the film. My complaint is that it was slow, there wasn't much dialogue, and at times it was just dull.","772":"I am so sorry, but this DVD just starts and then stops...it will not forward and it's been tried on several DVD players... I am disappointed.  This is the first item I bought that didn't work or was unsatisfactory, Amazon's products and resources are usually first rate.","773":"This is Meryl Streep at worst.  Cold, scheming nun.  Hard to believe her motives as wriiten in the script","774":"I don't like making negative comments but this time I feel obliged to warn people out there. This is just an over-over-rated movie. I insisted on watching it yesterday but although whatever I have tried I felt in to sleep. What a waste of time!","775":"I really found this movie slow and boring. I am pretty fair when it comes to judging movies but even my husband fell asleep. After watching I felt like I had waisted my time.","776":"I will NEVER do business with this seller again. I emailed them 4 times and they never had the courtesy to respond. The item never arrived and if I am charged for it I will dispute the charges. I guess this seller dosen't realize without us they wouldn't be in business.","777":"Saw this at the theater after hearing all the hype, and unfortunately, that is an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.  Nothing ever happens, nothing is resolved and the best part of it was when the credits rolled.","778":"This movie is cute, and kids will like it.  Pretty boring for adults though, so I wouldn't really recommend it even as a family movie.","779":"I normally praise Disney's animated movies, but I've got to draw the line somewhere. I can't believe the average review for this movie was 41\/2 stars. I found the characters in this movie annoying, even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff. I urge you to buy Treasure Planet, any Disney Pixar film,Tarzan before this one.","780":"This movie was terrible. The plot is very thin, even for kids, and G&eacute;rard Depardieu is a real flop. (Why isn't his PR photo from this movie at the mulletsgalore.com website?) The leading couple is cuter and more believable than the current issue 101 movie, but their love story is poorly written and very superficial.<p>The maccaw should have been named Jar Jar instead of Waddlesworth -- it was pointless, annoying, and dropped my raiting from two stars down to one.<p>Go to some garage sales and find the original children's books. Read to your children; don't buy this movie.","781":"It was too scratched up to be played. Kept sticking. Had to return this item. You should buy a new one instead of a used dvd.","782":"Ok, so it is not enough to watch Glenn Close freak out kids as much as she freaked out everyone in Fatal Attraction.  To watch her physically turn into some sort of demon is WAY too much for any child to absorb.  Disney, one word.  Booh.....","783":"The things I endure for Mr. Gruffudd.  If he thinks starring in the live-action sequel to the live-action remake of an animated Disney film is going to put him on Hollywood's radar, he's sadly mistaken.  Everyone associated with this flick should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.","784":"The only reason why I rented this movie was because Jude Law is in it. It just goes to show that all actors star in horrible movies from time to time. Watching &quot;Love,Honour and Obey&quot; is like watching a movies deleted scenes without watching the actual movie. Deleted scenes are often of low quality, there's no point to them and they're very boring. That sums this movie up in a nut shell.","785":"Lots of great features, but it doesn't play correctly on two of my three DVD players. It locks up on the JVC-XV-D723, and won't play on the Mac G3. The Imac G4 plays it fine. Nevertheless, it should work in all DVD players. I've contacted DisneyDVD about the problem, and we'll see how it goes.","786":"We ranked this 32 out of the 41 Disney animated movies that we own.  The best moment was the crows.  The writers just piled to much misery onto poor dumbo.","787":"The drunken pink elephant sequence went on WAY too long.  And how about those black crows? Disney will release this, but NOT release Song of the South?  Doesn't make sense!","788":"I saw this movie when I was five years old. My parents had to turn it off when I started crying. It's too scary for kids and if you really want to watch this movie watch it without your kids.","789":"Disney did not make this available in widescreen.  You would think that a newly released movie would be a little more \"this century\".  I returned it without even opening it.  It wasn't released in the theaters this way.  I'll wait until Disney releases a version without half the movie hacked off the sides.  BOO to Disney.","790":"This is one of our favorite Disney films.  Why the low rating?  The film ratios have been changed; in other words, the DVD is full screen instead of the original theatircal ratio of 1.75:1.  Come on Disney, offer DVD's in  their original format or give consumers both versions like the MULAN DVD.  Animated films from other studios (Iron Giant, Prince of Egypt) are  available in both formats.  Don't Disney fans deserve the best as well?","791":"I relied on my own fond childhood memories of this film when we decided to rent it for our son.  The characters are still cute and compelling, and the music is ok.  We were all having a lovely time until the racist stereotype of the Asian cat said something about a fortune cookie.  My four-year-old didn't seem to notice, but my wife and I instantly swapped uncomfortable glances.  It was a disappointing reminder of how stereotypes are learned from an early age, often through seemingly innocuous vehicles like cartoon movies.","792":"This 1970 animated feature is dull, careless, and all too typical of the Disney studio's slapdash output before the unexpected renaissance of The Rescuers Down Under. Interestingly, this is one of the few Disney features with cats for heroes; usually, felines provided Disney with his slimiest, sneakiest villains.","793":"Take Phil Harris as Baloo the Bear, make him a cat, and have him rescue beloved pets from a criminal who intends to do them harm. Replace Louis Prima with Scatman Crothers to provide a jumping musical interlude in the middle of the film. If you can stand watching a mediocre hybrid of 101 DALMATIANS and JUNGLE BOOK, you might consider buying this movie. Your viewing time (and your kids' time, too) would be better spent with other films.","794":"I did not view this dvd immediately because I was waiting for a visit from my granddaughter.  However, when I did attempt to watch it, it does not play.  As a matter of fact, it has a problem loading. There is no action whatsoever.  I would appreciate, very much, information regarding a replacement. Thank you for any help in this matter. Kathy Long digitfrontrange@yahoo.com","795":"the 3D does not work with the red and blue glass like is said it does. you have to buy shutter glasses that suck any way. if you buy any 3D dvd find out more, lots of them are not marked right. and need shutter glasses and not the red and blue ones.","796":"The Puppetmaster movie I received was not the one I ordered, plus the movie sent to me was unplayable.","797":"The quality is horrible. The screen shakes through the whole movie. The title screen is all in spanish even though the movie is in english. You would be better off recording it off the television.","798":"Case came completely shattered and in pieces with no 3D glasses to watch the movie and when the glasses to \"suit\" were finally found(bought at an additional cost)the copy was ludicrous.Complete waste of money.","799":"I HAVE WELL OVER 800 DICS IN MY HOME LIBRARY AND BEFORE I PURCHASED THE FULL BOX SET I ENDED UP WITH THIS PEICE OF WORK. IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE WORST SOUNDING DVD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. UPON GETTING THE ORIGINAL 2000 REALEASE I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT THE SOUND,COLOR,AND OVERALL QUALITY DIFERENCE.","800":"Dad returns home. Will and Holly are stuck in the Land of the Lost. New dinosaurs appear: a fire-breather and a two-headed fork-tongued terror. The kids discover their Uncle Jack is now trapped with them. Sounds like a promising season?  Could have been but, unfortunately, wasn't. Stay away from season three. Uncle Jack wasn't very likeable and the quality of the stories (other than maybe Aftershock) was far below the writing in seasons one and two.  For the Land of the Lost movie, please have Uncle Jack get crushed by a boulder during the earthquake sequence. Thanks!","801":"Richard Kiel, who played the James Bond baddie 'Jaws' was the best part of Season 3.  Other than that, everything else was horrible when compared to Season 1 and 2. The Marshall's even battle Greek villain Medusa in one episode.  This show turned into Gilligan's Island for the third season.  Way to many changes (story wise), a stupid new theme song, and the horrific addition of Uncle Jack ... bah ... now I'm upset again.  By the way, if they would have killed Gilligan, they would have escaped that damn island.  Kill Chaka and get home!","802":"Uncle Jack is almost worthless, and the slestak suddenly able to talk might seem like a good idea, but you know what they say about keeping your mouth shut and appearing to be an idiot vs. opening your mouth and removing all doubt?  Maybe worth buying if for no other reason than to finish out the set, but barely worth watching.","803":"The movie was well made with action, action, and then more action. I couldn't really find a plot or figure out just exactly who the good guys were until nearly the end of the movie. Teenagers will love it. Adults will probably get bored, like I did","804":"I was disappointed in this sequel, tho the special effects and most action was terrific. The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me. The ending was predictable early on, and was a clone of \"I Robot.\" The film's monotone coloration was depressing, and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls (huh?) and skeletal teeth (they eat hot dogs?) The attempt to weave in Arnold S. at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick (Terminator 2)felt disjointed and like an afterthot. Save your money.","805":"I thought Salvation was decent, and I was definitely considering purchasing it when it arrives on DVD...well, not anymore. The DVD version is only coming with the theatrical cut while the Blu-ray is coming with that AND the director's cut. Why? DVD is far from being a dead format. I know the studios and such are trying to promote Blu-ray and whatnot, but there are plenty of other ways to do this. Until the director's cut is available on DVD, no purchase from me.","806":"Can someone tell me what this movie was about? The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor. There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED. One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T \"be back\" if this is the best they can do!!","807":"Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut.  Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage.  DVD is still the top selling format.  Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.","808":"What's going on?  Why should I care about these characters?  Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends.  Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space.","809":"Earth is destroyed except for a few people and the machines.  John Connor gives Resistance radio pep-talks with all the inspiration of an annual tax form.  Death-row guy discovers that Skynet made him an infiltration Terminator and he screams, \"Noooooo!\"  Lots of fighting.  Stuff blows up.  Machines buzz.  Connor always escapes as the lone survivor of man-machine slaughtering while death-row infiltration Terminator keeps on fighting to save the day.  Neither man nor machine is deserving of victory and there's no prize for the winner.  It's just two hours of stuff grinding together.","810":"The Bottom Line:  Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.  2\/4","811":"I have really liked the the first three movies, even the goofy third. This one was difficult to follow. The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects. However, the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting. It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese, they weren't. Not really. Then, we have the end. I felt it was straining for some deep moral\/ethical statement, but just struck me as empty, loose and amateurish. I think it's really time to Terminate this series :)","812":"The digital copy included in the set expired in April 2010.  I just purchased it for the holidays.  I would not have purchased this set if I had known.  Now that it's open it can't be returned.","813":"I agree with everyone else here.  I call this an EPIC fail!  The sad part is, I own a PS3 and STILL won't buy this in protest!  I find it very offensive that only Blu Ray customers get the Director's Cut.","814":"This is the worst terminator movie. How anyone can like it is beyond me 1-3 were good this one was utter crap.","815":"This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins. Confusing and disjointed, frequently frustratingly illogical, it comes out boring, even with all the well-done CGI mayhem. Said mayhem is non-stop, becoming a mindless blur of disjointed human and robot body parts flying nowhere.  After the first two in the series, this one is even more of a disappointment, fans should see  this as a continuation of T3; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name. At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $9.99. Small consolation.","816":"I kept waiting for the movie to get going with suspense but it never did.  What a waste of time and money.","817":"If all you care about in a movie is one action sequence after another, hardly any dialog, zero character development, and no story.... this is defiantly the movie for you. This movie makes T3 look like a classic and the TV show Emmy worthy.","818":"This is not acceptable. Why am I not in this movie. You cannot self terminate, but you will all be terminated.","819":"the trailer for T:salvation was perhaps one of the better trailers I'd seen in  along time. Despite the fact that McG was directing, my expectations were high. But man was the movie disappointing. Sure the special effects were great, which is a credit to the animators and the budget for FX, but everything else was just terrible. The story was WEAK, the acting mediocre, the editing choppy and all the fun of the previous terminator movies was completely missing. It was an overserious bore.","820":"Totally unorginal film!  Don't bother with this tripe, I would write more but is impossible to make this movie any worse than it is!!!!!","821":"I can't review this transaction because I never got the movie.  I thought that maybe things were backlogged around Christmas, but it's February...and still no movie.","822":"- The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.  - There's no suspense in this movie. Terminator 2 is suspenseful from the beginning till the end.  - There are a lot of actions but they're not engaging as those of Terminator 2 either.  - It was supposed to be touching at the end when someone scarified to give his heart to another person but I was not moved. I don't know it's because of bad directing or acting. It might be both.","823":"Get the Terminator Salvation (Two-Disc Director's Cut + Digital Copy) rated R from Amazon.ca  (Amazon Canada)  Product Details Actors: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin Directors: McG Format: NTSC, Color Language: English Number of discs: 2 Studio: Warner Home Video DVD Release Date: Dec 1 2009 Run Time: 118 minutes Average Customer Review: No customer reviews yet.

The acting, dialogue, directing.  Even the CGI wasn't that good.  Steaming Pile of....","827":"I found myself watching the movie and some thing felt amiss it was an action packed movie but something just was alittle off. McG just doesnt get it right I loved the fist 3 movies yea even #3 I loved the sarah connor chronicles but this movie just wasnt terminator I walked away feeling very dissapointed","828":"This is by far the worst Terminator Movie ever.None of the action of previous movies.No major fight scenes like in the first movie between the robots and humans Lots of talking and no action.If you liked the action in the 3rd one (a lot of people obviously did not by what I have been reading for other reviews) then stay away from this one. I never fall asleep in movies but I begged for a pillow.lOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKED THIS ONE BUT ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE I got your back!!!!!","829":"T4 isn't as good as the 1st.  I had a movie ticket to use, & Paramount wasn't showing Star Trek that night. It was OK.  I rate it Z4, as in ZZZZ.","830":"I ordered this movie about 10 days before Christmas as a Christmas present and it never arrived.  I'm still waiting for some kind of word, even from Amazon.  Still nothing even after contacting twice via email. I'm surprised Amazon even lets this kind company on their web site. Isn't collecting money under false pretenses illegal?  Thanks Amazon.","831":"I won't add any spoilers here for those of you who don't know how the movie ends. I liked the movie... until the end. What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me. Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that.","832":"For me this was the least liked Terminator movie,, I even liked 3 better. It was a bit corney and watching Cristian Bale is hard to do after hearing his screaming rant temper tantrum he had while making the movie, its just hard to like or support an actor that is such a jerk in real life. Cheers Davyo","833":"This film was atrociously bad.  I wouldn't watch it again if it was running free on network TV, much less buy a copy of it.  It was pathetic in all aspects...","834":"Bought this movie as a Christmas present at a great price.  Saving on each present means more presents for the folks on my list.  Thank you Amazon for helping me out.","835":"Terminator movies should have stopped after the amazing T2 movie directed by James Cameron. Terminator Salvation is by far the worst Terminator movie out of all 4. It really makes T3 look like a masterpeice, eventhough I did not likt Terminator 3 that much. Christian Bale does not fit as John Connor at all. I can't believe from what I heared that he will be in 2 more Terminator Films. LET THE TERMINATOR MOVIES GO TO REST. IT IS LOSING ITS PLACE IN THE GREAT SCI FI MOVIE LIST.","836":"I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much.  Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.  Peter J. Miller","837":"This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this \"HD\" blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv. Even broadcast looks better on my TV...Story was mediocre, and special effects were OK ...would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise.","838":"I had actually watched his forgot about it, rented it realized I had watched it and thought very little at it. Basically the series lost all momentum, in this movie.","839":"This movie was good, if you've never read the book, the book is so much better so if you are thinking of buying\/seeing this movie do it before you read the book, please.","840":"Was very disappointed in this product.  I could have gone to Wal-mart and bought it for the same price.  It is a pirated copy that was made in Mexico and all it had on it was some previews for some different movie.  Be careful when you purchase movies from here.","841":"I ended up finally getting to watch this movie on Lifetime. I ordered this movie from you AMAZON and You took my Money and Never Sent It. I was a regular customer however I have no trust anymore. No phone numbers to contact anyone???","842":"Watching the first season was painful as hell. There were a few funny moments, but for the most part, it was just hard to watch. The later seasons have gotten much better. So give the season some time and it becomes irresistible.","843":"disappointed that it was dvd only, no program insert or episode listing...just a dvd in original case. But I did order a used one...buyer beware.","844":"This has to be the lamest most stupid TV show ever.  Good humor is rooted in reality. However, rather than being a dilbert type where there is reality The Office just goes off the deep end of stupid. The boss would have been fired years ago. The supporting characters are weak and apathetic.  The characters and dialogue are painful to the eyes and ears. The writers should be embarrassed and hold their heads in shame.  This show I do not blame on acting, this one lays at the feet of producers, director, and script writers.","845":"Like other reviewers I found this show to be hard to understand because of the accents.  I am very intelligent college grad, executive, however, the dialect, the humor, the jokes are all a real miss.  I was not pleased to have invested time in this series. The only real redeeming fact was that it does have a typical \"office\" setting with typical \"office\" employees without typical \"office\" days.  Get this from the library if you really want to see it.  Don't waste your money!","846":"Being a Brit and loving most British Comedy, I have to say this was the unfuniest thing to come from Great Britain since John Major. Watched the first series from start to finish in One Night. Only laughed once at the beginning of the first episode. Had to watch all six episodes because most people said it was good. I don't understand, either I'm losing it or it was rubbish. I don't think I'll waste $30 on the second series.","847":"The BBC version is great. The NBC version is awful.  I guess they had to dumb it down for the American audience.  Sad....","848":"I ordered this series a month ago, I received in the mail a completely different movie addressed to someone in connecticut ( I live in Louisiana) I then payed out of my own pocket to mail it to the address on the slip.  I contacted the seller and they said they would work on getting me my product.  Then yesterday I sent an email to see what was going on and they told me they have confirmation of delivery a month ago.  So now I have to reexplain what happened to what I am assuming is a different employee.","849":"This one is just plain terrible. I rented this after seeing the Forty Year Old Virgin and can't believe it's the same guy in both. I can't believe that they even call this a comedy. Reviewers are comparing this to Seinfeld? Seinfeld was a beautiful exercise in subtlety. The Office is about as subtle as an elephant on roller skates and nowhere near as funny.","850":"Americans took the genius script of Ricky Gervais, watered it down and completely missed the point.","851":"It's not funny or interesting at all. I can't believe this is even out on DVD with only six terrible episodes when so many great shows aren't on DVD. Who let Steve Carrell pick this bomb for his first starring role? There's nothing redeeming at all about this series for me to even mention, as it's poorly conceived and executed. Avoid it and watch Anchorman if you want to see Carrell in a good role.","852":"It is the most depressive and unpleasant show I have ever seen in my life. I've caught myself turning my face off the TV.. It is about cocaine-boosted idiot that runs a small office of several fully suppressed individuals. All I feel about these people is sincere sorry - this show calls no smile on my face, not even speaking of laugh or joy. They are trying to pick up on some office stereotypes and insanities but they go so far that it feels more like a clinic... Not recommended at all.","853":"I enjoyed the episodes that were on the DVD.... but I thought, with the title THE OFFICE SEASON ONE, it would include all the episodes of Season One and not just 3.  I was left wanting more....... much more!  However, the three episode included in this DVD were funny.","854":"Steve Carrell's acting job in this comedy is just unbelievable. As other reviewers have noted, his character is so outrageous and so out-of-bounds that he's totally unbelievable. That dooms the rest of the show, as everything revolves around Carrell's character. Maybe he was trying to top the BBC version, but I expected so much better from him after seeing his movie roles, that this show was a total letdown.","855":"the office was supposed to be an english show using english humour you try to use american humour its just not going to work at all","856":"I saw all the episodes on season 1. I was horrified, it wasn't even funny. You should probably re-think your idea of funny before watching it.","857":"This movie is pretty interesting.  Ben Affleck as a college student is a stretch, considering he tried to go to college in real life.  This movie does not really go into glory days of college, but a look at four guys future after college.  Pretty lame.","858":"I guess the lowest rating you can give a movie is one star...otherwise I would have given this movie zero stars.  It was TOTALLY unentertaining, not funny at all.  DO NOT BUY THIS, and don't waste 3 dollars renting it.  And  don't waste the hour wathcing it either.  Time would be better spent  building a fort out of lima beans.","859":"A melange of mumbo-jumbo that is esentially unwatchable and unbearably boring.  Adds little or nothing to our understanding of the Unabomber or the emergence of the internet.  In addition, this film does not provide captions or subtitles when English is spoken, and this may be a major deterrent for viewers who rely on them.","860":"After this long you would think they could at least release this show in its entirety and not play with us. I was very dissappointed. They could have at least put the Chipmunk Song on here. Oh well, back to YouTube.","861":"I was very disappointed - got all settled in to watch classic episodes that I remember from the early 60s only to find that I got one great episode and the rest that 80s stuff !","862":"When I saw the artwork, I thought, \"Finally!\"  And then I read the details.  Only 1 show?  I don't think so.  But when the complete series is released, I'm there.","863":"Not the entire first season, just the first episode of the first season (one of twenty-six ever produced, in 1961). Very good film to DVD transfer, but at slightly under thirty minutes this is not very economical.","864":"We played the game. We bought the one-show only disc. We watched and re-watched that great first show. We fast-forwarded endlessly through the post-1980's badly-done fake Alvin junk that overflows on this disc. This was a great series, created to be seen. What a joke! Now, it simply languishes in film-vault-limbo, seen by NOBODY. A sad and stupid ending to a fantastic memory. And all the while, a new version of Alvin (doesn't resemble him one iota) is everywhere (urk).","865":"The initial shows--they were a product of the era, and that era of cartoon animation contained guns, bombs idiots and falling anvils. They were rough and scrappy, not the overwrought slicked up pretension of PC they are today. But we know crap sells.  I recall the vivid Witch Doctor video. Someone worked on that one, because the  visual parade of  authentic Tribal masks were educational and brain candy.  Pity they had to go and sweeten up the Chimpmunks.","866":"I didnt receive this dvd...they sent me the movie of alvin and the chipmunks, not the one I wanted...I wanted this one....","867":"The movie was entertaining but there are better movies of the era (Northwest Passage) or new films (Last of the Mohicans and Patriot). The film and plot is fair but not one of my favorites.","868":"Henry Fonda is one of my favorite actors, but his performance in this movie is very lacking.  Seems to be in a constant depression through the whole movie.  And the acting overall is subpar, like they were just reading lines.  Ward Bond is the standout of them all for his small role.  The history takes a back seat to the action.  And, there is no felt connection between Fonda and Claudette, especially after he slaps her at the beginning of the movie for being a distraught woman.  I would not recommend the movie.","869":"I was very disappointed in this movie and stpped watching after a short while.  Some who just like old movies, or who want to see Henry Fonda when he was young might like this movie.  Normally I like old movies and I like \"costume Dramas\" but this one was too light for me.","870":"This is a great film, but do NOT buy the copy of the DVD with the airplane on the cover, it is TERRIBLE.  Fuzzy, poor sound quality, cheap graphics on the outside of the DVD case.  It looks like something tossed together by some company who makes bootleg copies from the t.v.  I've never heard of the company (Timeless Classics), and on top of everything else it arrived scratched and loose in the case. Movie, five stars, DVD quality, MINUS 5.","871":"The title says it all.  This would have been a much more enjoyable movie had the original that was used have been a good one.  At best I could only give the quality of the picture a C- or D+.","872":"The DVD case says the film is B&W. Unfortunately the DVD is technicolor. Video quality is blurry, washed out and unwatchable.  I would have preferred a crisp B&W version.  This version is a waste of time and money.  Could not even finish watching this DVD because of the poor quality.","873":"Too pshycadelic for me. Confusing w\/o concise descriptions. Hard to understand what they are showing you except the droning chant like narration","874":"This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...","875":"Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.  Stewart Schofield","876":"well, this was not a real Disney copy of the movie.  Plays fine.  But for the price I expected a authentic Disney copy","877":"I thought I was purchasing the special edition of Pinocchio--at least, that was the picture of the dvd that was on the website.  What I got was a Korean version. I got my money back.","878":"It looks more like a VHS transfer than an actual serious release. Where's widescreen? If you want to collect it since it will disappear, then go for  it. Some day in the future Disney will re-release it again with all the  goodies. Until then, this is Disney's chance to make back the money lost  with Divx.","879":"Pinocchio is one of my favorite movies and my children love it as well.  What a gift it was to get it on DVD!  But upon putting it in the player today, found out that the Prince of Egypt was actually on it.  The cover and holder showed Pinocchio.  This was a very sad mistake by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.","880":"This dvd has close captioning which cannot be taken off which is distracting to the kids.  It would appear that this isn't an original copy.","881":"i thought this would be a great combo pack for my 3 month old son but it's more like an introductory trial product rather than full versions of media","882":"While the film can be funny sometimes and it does have some decent action scenes. Dennis Rodman was okay in this film. Not great but pretty good. The plot is soo stupid as wacthing a John Cena match. The Cyber Monks & Dane Cook are soo annoying,you wish they were in a Final Destination film so they can get kill off right away. Overall,it's ok if you are a Dennis Rodman fan. I give this film a 4 out of 10.","883":"I watch this movie than gave it away or pawned it. Whatever. It's a lame movie.","884":"ORDERED BEFORE JULY 4TH. STILL NOT RECEIVED EMAILS NEVER ANSWERED NO CREDIT GIVEN I JUST WANT THE 2 DVD'S I ORDERED","885":"Alright I'm a big fan of the guy, but Phenomena just didn't impress me. The acting was pretty bad, the story just doesn't make much sense, not a lot of his cool shots, not a lot of gore until the end and it has a monkey smarter then everybody else. But there was a couple of cool scenes throughout the film. I guess the story was my main problem, just didn't buy it, but it might be your cup of tea.","886":"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life! Video Renters Beware, you wouldn't want to rent this movie because of how stupid it is. It was so freaking boring and stupid I wouldn't even want to pay attention to this movie one more time! I HATE it!","887":"This movie could have benefited from so many things.  Acting, Acoustics and Story line were the major shortcomings.  When I read the other review, words like dreamlike and 80's classic horror were used.  Maybe a hallucination but not dreamlike, and defiantly no classic.  I consider the time watching this movie well wasted.","888":"Low budget Italian horror with an American star.  Good? No.  Unsettling, quirky and peculiarly charming? Yes.  Worth the time it takes to watch it? No.","889":"Unable to understand why am I sold an item that knowingly cannot be played on my dvd. I feel like I've been robbed, and nothing will be done about it! This is the 4th piece of garbage to be sold to me!","890":"This movie starts out alright, with some good chase scenes and a few shoot-outs, but then it just becomes incredibly boring. Detroit 9000 becomes so slow paced, that it will put you to sleep.<p>SNOR-FEST.....ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz","891":"I purchased this video hoping to find joyful music from the world: polkas, tango, mariachis, african music. But you can't find any of those. The dvd is a collage of images with music composed by the baby einstein musicians, which doesn't represent the Music of the world. It is very boring. My children, who are the Baby Einstein biggest fans hardly look at it. Dissapointing.","892":"This video has some beautiful cinematography. The music is pretty, but sometimes doesn't match the country that is being shown. My biggest problem with this video involves the misbehaving puppets. In one segment, one puppet steals the other puppet's hat and runs away. In another segment, one puppet has more fruit on its head so the other puppet pushes her. I think these puppets are modeling bullying behavior.","893":"Watered-down, dumbed-down, sanitized music. I know that's Baby E's m.o. for the most part but come on. Not only is the music bad, the choice of images is also boring. I will not subject my toddler to this again. Yikes.","894":"This title is completely misleading, and this video does not feature anything especially arduous--that anyone would think would lead to weight loss (per se).  It is a decent beginners yoga DVD, that's it.","895":"This DVD was a disappointment.  They tried to make it accessible to users of many different levels and in my opinion they made it difficult to use.  They actually recommend that you watch it first before using it.  I wanted to work out - not watch a work out DVD.  Go for Rodney Yee instead for a good (but slow) yoga workout","896":"I bought this DVD believing by the title that it was going to be a fast-paced yoga workout that left my muscles screaming in pleasure\/pain by the end.  Not so.  I was bored to tears, and I'm no yoga expert - I'd say that I'm moderately skilled at yoga.  Anyone who is new to yoga and wants a calming, S-L-O-W workout - this one's for you.","897":"A good work out in theory, but trying to put four different instructors on one DVD means the DVD keeps skipping, you constantly have to pick up the remote to get back to the position you were in.  The positions are okay - but again they concentrate too much on giving you too many modifications rather than really explaining the stretches and breathing.  Gets boring after a few times.  Overall this DVD has focused too much on being interactive and giving too many choices - it messes up the format and takes away from the actual yoga.","898":"As with several other reviewers, I cannot access the Personal Instructor feature on my DVD player...it's a reasonably new and popular model, and I have never had any problem with any other DVD...extremely disappointing...  UPDATE: I contacted Gaiam & they promptly send me a replacement DVD (that's the good news)...the bad news: it still doesn't work on my DVD player (a Toshiba). So be warned: All the bells & whistles won't necessarily function as advertised, and that significantly reduces the value of this DVD.","899":"I wanted to like this DVD, but it was so boring I couldn't finish it. My review is based on about 20 minutes of the 1\/4 modified routine. It wasn't too hard for me, but it was too slow. It confirmed for me that my Pilates workouts are much more engaging for me. If you don't mind a very slow class than this is for you. The weight loss angle seems added on. I'm not sure that this is challenging enough to make you burn any more calories than a brisk walk.","900":"I am not experienced in Yoga.  Although I work out regularly, I have only attended about 8 yoga classes and I only started about 9 months ago.  Therefore, I assumed that I was a beginner.  However, I would say that this DVD is only for people who have NEVER been to a yoga class and probably have not exercised much at all.  Overall, I found the program pleasant and they did have some good tips and reminders within the workout, however, I did not get a good workout--just a good mid-day stretch.","901":"This DVD is titled \"Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss,\" yet the instructor states in the introduction that she's never had a weight problem.  So why is she teaching this routine?  I found her to be very annoying.  Further, the DVD formatting is really strange, where you can pick between 1\/2 modified, fully modified, etc.  There are just too many choices, and this makes the DVD 4 hours and 20 minutes, but it's the same routine about 4 different ways.  On the other hand, I tried crunch yoga (Joy of Yoga, and Fat Burning Yoga) and really enjoyed both.","902":"This was definitely a disappointment.  I figured that the 4 modified levels would offer me a challenge.  I did the unmodified level the entire time, and it was still a beginner level session.  And don't let the title  fool you.  The part &quot;For Weight Loss&quot; is only serving to feed  into the weight loss industry.","903":"This Blu ray will only play in the USA and this information is not advertised on the Amazon website. Buyer beware. Very disappointed H&K fan in Australia <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006H3MJCQ\">Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle \/ Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay (Double Feature) [Blu-ray<\/a>]","904":"This Blu ray will only play in the USA and this information is not advertised on the Amazon website.  Buyer beware.  Very disappointed H&K fan in Australia","905":"Do not buy from this vendor.  I have seen this movie on TCM and been very impressed with a number of shots.  When I watched this copy I was convinced it must be a warn VHS tape recorded on DVD because the last time I saw such a bad picture was under those conditions (on the tape not recorded to DVD).  It has the light showing on screen throughout the whole movie.  Also the great B\/W scenes do not have great contrasts.  I received the tape promptly BUT that's all that was acceptable in this transaction.","906":"The movie is a classic.  The print was very poor and I would not recommend to anyone purchasing.","907":"If you're an Errol FLynn fan let me warn you, Flynn hardly ever even gets to touch a sword in this film!  He's very cramped in this roll; and even much of his ordinary charm, doesn't come through.","908":"A truly strange movie...slavery is ok, and the South will \"sort it out\" in good time. Movies like this built racism and made lynchings possible. Slavery itself isnof course absent from the movie, except for a scared family trying to escape. But never mind, some people will never care. Avoid.","909":"I like the bowery boy, but the quality of these transfers are questionable. It would be nice to see a decent print of these films with half way decent audio quality.","910":"Movie Spooks Run Wild was not able to play. Picture was jumpy.First picture ran ok.","911":"Not as I remembered them.  I didn't like the quality or the movie.  Like a very old show, which is what it was.  I use to laugh when I was a kid.  Not funny as an adult.","912":"A lovely film with poor sound quality and no subtitles in english to make up for it. Bad buy.","913":"This video itself is cool but if you are buying this for 3d effect... forget about it and just buy the standard bluray or dvd version. the 3d verision I have tells you to put your 3d glasses on in parts of the video & take them off through most of the video. that's why I gave this a 1 star. The 3d effect may be on this video but I have yet to experience it. I expected the whole bluray to be 3d not 3d enhanced!!","914":"I was going to use the USB and watch the video on my computer and it asked me for a SERIAL CODE  i tried the one on the product and it did not work . It's frustrating that i couldn't watch the video , i just got a normal usb with a fancy cover That's it!","915":"This order was supposed to contain the Blueray Disc and a DVD. That's what was advertised and that's what I paid for... only got the Blueray Disc. The content is great, I just didn't get what I paid for.","916":"This movie was excellent at the theatre in IMAX but loses it's magic on the small screen.  Sound quality is horrible - it goes up and down in waves throughout the movie.  I would not recommend purchasing...","917":"I was excited to find this DVD at Amazon before it hit the stores, but not a week after I recieved my order, the same DVD was at Wal-mart for the same price with 2 disc not just one.  So I was alittle disappointed. I may check the store prices before ordering again.","918":"Most of the scenes have a Michael impersonator and the singing does not sound like him at all to me. Like the recording his doctor made of Michael that they played in court, Michael could not make sense talking and he sure could not sing close to the end. By not making this video they could have left previous videos of Michael shine so that the terrible video This Is It! would not shatter anybody's great memory of Michael.","919":"This item requires that you enter a digital rights code that is printed on the package.  With its printing, in my case it was impossible to read.  Item is now nothing more than overpriced USB flash drive.","920":"REALLY WANTED THIS DVD BUT IT WOULD NOT PLAY ON ANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS.THE SELLERS WERE VERY NICE THOUGH AND GAVE ME AN IMMEDIATE REFUND.I WOULD PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SO NICE.","921":"The man was a great performer, but this is just another sad example of a family and friends making money of him now that he is gone. The Jackson family cares about money and not Michael.","922":"It was a 'behind the scenes' of what could've been.  Michael Jackson was entertaining to watch.  His songs were hits.  That's it.  People claiming Michael Jackson was a life-changing force must consider looking at themselves first.  It doesn't help that people are so quick jump on the band wagon and deify him.  Michael Jackson was just a guy doing what he enjoyed.","923":"I bought this blue ray.Unfortunatly i see this blue ray doesn't work.Amazon don't say this blue ray work only for Region A.So this BD it is not compatible with my blue ray player.Please Amazon offer clients real information about DVD,BD...Why say this blue ray it is compatible for Region 1? Shame Amazon...:(","924":"I've seen him live and this was just ok.  Not worth the money and not worth supporting his legal trust! Try to find a free boot leg of a concert some where and you'll get a better \"tear\" jerking experience. I only cried when i heard how much it cost.(got it as a present.)  And ended up selling it for more than that. :-) (BONUS!) Don't waste you're money, rent it.","925":"Everyone that paid to see this movie is a winner of the coveted \"Help Michael's greedy friends and all of the rich folks capitalize off of his death\/possible murder\" Award!!! In showing your financial support of this vile situation, you've helped support the people who helped to mold him into a the freak that he became. There's nothing wrong with wanting to see the movie, but giving people that cruel and greedy your hard-earned cash is a crime in and of itself.","926":"The major problem facing the producers of THIS IS IT is the dearth of any recent hits by Jackson, meaning the songs performed here are all very dated and fail to engage the audience in any meaningful manner.","927":"too bad he dired dr kildare then we would have something better   just say no soes that make any sense anymore????","928":"All that wonderful cinematography appears to be shot with the 2nd unit. All the action in which the actors are recognizable takes place on a movie set that reminds me of an expensive version of the Bonanza set. Sinatra and Mcqueen have good performances. But the director, writer, and producer did a lousy job! Maybe they made this movie to capitalize on the success of The Bridge on the River Kwai.","929":"I was disappointed in this movie. I've seen a lot of the older 1940's war movies and they are always intertaining with good plots. This was lacking in action and acting. It turned out to be more theatrical. Not worth seeing in my opinion.","930":"I thought that this was another Stargate SG-1 movie. Boy was I wrong! IMO the people who made this video and who subscribe to this bizzare theory have named the DVD in a way as to incourage Stargate SG-1 fans to purchase it and thus increase sales. SG-1 fans: STAY AWAY, this is not for you.","931":"If I want to sit through a boring presentation where every noteworthy concept is repeated 9 times I'd go back to school where I can at least have fun with my fellow students.  Don't buy the terribly bad filmed presentation buy the book instead. I mean his theories are as crazy as they are interesting to know about but far better to absorb in written form.","932":"This is really weak. Take 'Chariots of the gods' meet the History Channel mythology division, toss in the name STARGATE and you have this weak, watered down presentation.","933":"I guess I should have looked at the reviews of this DVD before I bought it. It has nothing to do with Stargate, Stargate SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis.  Its a 2 dvd lecture on metaphysics.  Yawn.","934":"The title sounded interesting but the product was boring.  This man took everything he could put his hands on to talk quite unauthoratatively.  I recommend you DO NOT buy this.  But, it is your money you waste if you want to throw it away!","935":"This was used so I know it was not going to be perfect (case, clarity of tape, etc.) But, this would not work and never did getting it working even cleaning video head, different and newer VHS players, etc.  Would not buy used again though I am sure the seller had to have known it wouldn't work and sent it to me anyways.  Hard to say for sure, huh? Buyer beware.","936":"Sorry but the quality of this DVD was HORRIBLE. I returned it after viewing 2 minutes. I love DVDs for the quality of the picture and this has tons of movie projector black marks--you know the marks you get watching an old 16mm film. Someone took an old 16mm film and simply recorded onto DVD, much like some of those cheap Paramount DVDs (Bram Stoker's Dracula comes to mind). Digitally remaster this and maybe I'll be impressed.","937":"This film has virtually nothing to offer. Robert De Niro is out of place (as much as I value his talent). Hawke is kind of weird, especially in his badly executed &quot;teenage&quot; look. The New York's Art Scene is highly irritating, as is the &quot;eccentric aunt&quot; most of the times. I think Paltrow's nude picture on the cover helped to promote this film.","938":"It may be partly the stilted dialogue, but the acting in this film is wooden. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful as ever but I think she was in the process of learning to act during the film. It is not worth the time. A much better literary movie starring Paltrow is \"Shakespeare in Love\"","939":"This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.","940":"It could be erotic at times, but for my understanding it was not a great film, Its pointless, so if You want to see just rent it, I got mislead with other reviewers about the film","941":"I have seen this movie two years ago. I still have quite vivid movies about it.... Now I have been in Japan for a year and can better relate to the culture as an average american could. So if you don't know Japan don't see it. If you do if might be worth while.","942":"I like Mira, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. How in the world she got involved in this production (including a couple of cast members from the mini-series, The Sopranos...which, BTW, do horrible acting), is beyond me! The 4 and 5 star ratings on this vid were the reason I purchased it. One man's poison is another man's treasure, but this 'dog' is just that: a Dog!","943":"Please do not torture your children.  Send them to camp, maybe even camp in Arizona. Read a story about summer camp in Arizona.  Let them watch Raising Arizona.  Do not, however, rent or even think about buying this movie.  It was only made because director Joey Travolta is John's brother; terrible is not a strong enough adjective. Bad acting, cheesy set-up, and unintentional moments of humor for those of drunken persuasion.","944":"I have not gotten the tape to play. I am having a friend over soon to help. Perhaps, I have not connected the VHS correctly. Ask me again later this month please? Awaiting, impatiencely to review. Thanks.","945":"When I finally received 1 of my two stuffs one month after my transaction, I had to pay 12,50 euros extra fee.  Actually I'm still waiting for my second stuff !!!!  It whas the most bad transaction I had with AMAZON !!!!  REALLY BAS OPINION","946":"This is a barely adequate production of the great Mozart Opera.  The spare stage settings create little of the \"Singspiel\" magic that this opera requires.  Franciso Araiza is uninspiring as Tamino but other members of the cast are generally good - Kathleen Battle is appropriately girlish as Pamina, Kurt Moll provides some gravitas as Sarastro, and Manfred Hemm provides some energy and humour as Papageno.  This production never springs to life and after a while one just sits there feeling bored.  Sound and picture quality are OK.","947":"I was very disappointed because the VHS tape was not in good condition and was truly unviewable.  The picture wasn't steady .  I gave up trying to view it after a short while.  Perhaps it might have been a good performance if the VHS had been in good condition.  I love this opera and was shocked that a VHS would be shipped in this poor condition.","948":"Plainly re-hashing too many movies, you can almost see the whole crew getting sick of it towards the end, as we all were. I don't think there's any point in it, except to make a bit of money, which no-one can actually object to; but nobody laughed much at the cinema where I saw it, except maybe at David Duchovny's arse.","949":"I really dislike this movie. The cast was good and there were like 2 good laughs but it was just worthless. The story line was very bad and the dialouge was even worse. I was about a metoer than crashed into the Earth. when they found it, it was leaking this blue stuff. When David Duchovny looked at it through a microscope he sees that it is growing exremely fast. I dont  feel like telling anymore because this movie sickened me. Save your money. DONT see this movie.","950":"This movie is so not funny it's frightening. I think I may have giggled a total of about two times throughout the entire hour and forty minutes of show time. Has Hollywood truly still not matured to the point where a comedy can come out that doesn't rely on bathroom humor and racial jokes? Jeeze Duchovny, how could you stoop to this level...","951":"This movie has one of the most outrageous plots I have ever seen.  It is also full of about (by my count), 300 movie cliches.  I went to see the movie hoping for a good laugh (at least I got one or two of those) and my money's worth (did not get this).","952":"Evolution is probably one of the most painfully bad movies, I have seen in years. A &quot;comedy&quot; with absolutely no wit or humor. I suppose somebody had a story concept, pitched it to the right people and cast it with better than adequate actors....BUT FORGOT TO WRITE THE SCRIPT! Imagine a really long, labored, and unfunny Saturday Night Live sketch and you get the idea. I love Julianne Moore, but what was she thinking?!","953":"See other reviews on this page for the reason why you should not buy this dvd if you live in the USA.  If you are interested in the Green Hornet, look for the dvd in the NTSC format, probably linked on this same page.","954":"I bought it used in May 2002 and I never received it and Amazon never refunded my money. I went through their complaint department three times with no luck. The seller was Weasle or something like that. Stick with in stock items. James from Hanford, Ca. USA","955":"Do Not Purchase my Friend and I were taken as well ! There not Honest a totall waste of time and Money .","956":"This was a scope movie, with a theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. This DVD is panned and scanned and it ruins the movies dynamism and impact. The action scenes are terrific and truly exciting but THIS is not the way to watch them. A shameful DVD with unacceptable sound and picture quality. Pray for an SE re-release and buy that instead.","957":"I honestly don't know what Artisan were thinking by releasing this in pan and scan with terrible Dolby 2.0 sound that desperately needs remastering. The cropped 1.33:1 picture is grainy and has quite a lot of speckles and dirt thru-out. This really is Dolph's best movie and Segal makes for a seriously cool villain but with this pathetic treatment by Artisan all the cool gun battles and car chases and explosions are just as rubbish as they were on VHS. Pick it up if the price temps but don't expect much.","958":"Why oh why is this in pan and scan only. This is a 2.35:1 framed movie and the well balanced and well composed cinematography is completely ruined on this DVD. About half the movie is missing. I love Joshua Tree but I won't buy this DVD. Artisan must understand this simply won't do. Sadly, the only widescreen version out there is the Japanese Laserdisc. And that's LONG out of print.","959":"This was a scope movie, with a theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. This DVD is panned and scanned and it ruins the movies dynamism and impact. The action scenes are terrific and truly exciting but THIS is not the way to watch them. A shameful DVD with unacceptable sound and picture quality. Pray for an SE re-release and buy that instead.","960":"But this film really is wrecked and mutilated in pan and scan. I love this movie but I won't buy Artisan's DVD which does not even have the movies real title, &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;.","961":"Another spectacle from action star Dolph Lundgren who was made famous for his legendary fight with Sly Stallone in Rocky IV. Lundgren stars as escapes from the hands of the law only to lead them on a series of car chases and plot twists. I highly recomend you check out some of Lundgren good performances in Universal Soldier and Showdown in Little Tokyo, in which Brandon Lee rocks.","962":"See other reviews on this page for the reason why you should not buy this dvd if you live in the USA.  If you are interested in the Green Hornet, look for the dvd in the NTSC format, probably linked on this same page.","963":"I bought it used in May 2002 and I never received it and Amazon never refunded my money. I went through their complaint department three times with no luck. The seller was Weasle or something like that. Stick with in stock items. James from Hanford, Ca. USA","964":"Do Not Purchase my Friend and I were taken as well ! There not Honest a totall waste of time and Money .","965":"It should be a law against making movies this bad. First the whole plot was completely stupid and the actors should be shot for such a poor performance. Come on I know that it was a low budget movie but just how low can you get! Please do not buy,rent or even look in the direction of this movie if you know whats good for you. Its not worth your time!!!!","966":"Most of the time I always like B Movies.However this one was one I disliked,it had poor acting and the pirate in the movie was horrible.Thank god I didnt spend no more then a buck for it and even then that was to much.","967":"This is a fine Randolph Scott film. Unfortunately the DVD has interference on the audio channel (bass-heavy contemporary music, as if someone was playing something through the board when the transfer was made) and the print itself shows damage in places. I have never encountered a major studio release with this level of audio interference. Thanks for caring, Columbia Pictures!","968":"I don't really mind the cheap animation. It's more the cliched, near offensive parts. If you want your kids to watch movies with the phrase \"junk in the trunk\" in it then watch this. For my kids, I'll skip it. It's not as crude as more modern \"kids\" movies but there is still plenty for me not to like.  Yes, I am happily prudish with what I want my kids watching.","969":"..just a let down since the first two movies where whimsical and fun.. and in Live Action.  Nope, didn't like it one bit.","970":"nothing near the quality of the first two stuart little movies and not enough to keep the little one's attention long enough to enjoy it...  the storyline is good, but it failed to hit the pre-schoolers level of excitement like the first two movies did.  they were bored within minutes of the movie starting..","971":"My DVD automatically displays English subtitles as the default setting. This happens every time we play it. I got it for my niece who's 4, and she always has to ask someone to reset it to display no subtitles. ( She otherwise can just hit the play button to start a DVD.) I was NOT happy with that. This info should have been stated on this website. I would never have bought it if I knew this. Poorly made cartoon, although my niece still watches it because she likes Stuart.","972":"LOW BUDGET,BAD ACTING,IF IT'S NEGATIVE,IT APPLIES TO THIS FILM......HA,FILM!THIS....THING DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE CALLED A FILM,THIS ...THING SEEMS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN A RENTED SHACK IN MEXICO FOR ABOUT 8 MAYBE 9 PESOS LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF AT THE VIDEO STORE,THANK YOU.","973":"I like \"creature\" flicks - even the bad ones - so had high hopes this movie would be at least entertaining.  It wasn't.  Much of the movie makes no sense (the creature can read minds and yet apparently can't?) and the rest of it was just a jumble of weird bizarre images that didn't gel.  Do yourself a favor - watch Lake Placid and pass on this one.","974":"Amazon is offering this film along with \"The Off Season\" in a package deal. SKIP THEM BOTH!  This is really bad simply because it is not a really honest attempt to create a decent horror film. This is as bad as those awful \"Brain Damage\" films.  yuck.","975":"This is a Great movie....for a drinking game! Everytime someone laughs they have to drink up! And with this movie, there will be alot of drinking!!! Even The highest B.A.C. reached by playing this game will be higher than the feckless mahu Okole Puka's IQ who made this Lapuwale work of art! Other than that, its Awe-some......Drink up!","976":"What a just aweful movie. The acting is absolutely aweful,the CGI is terrible and the whole premisae is disgusting. I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is. The dialog between the characters is unbelievable bad. I though to myself within 5 minutes\"I can't believe this movie was made\". There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It shouldn't have been made for theater or DVD!","977":"I've seen many movies in my lifetime and I can honestly say, without question, that this is the worst movie ever produced.  The CGI and the entire plot is a joke.  The only reason to watch this movie is for a strip-tease scene which was only a few minutes.  Please, do yourself a favor and do not waste a minute watching this movie.  Do not be fooled by the DVD cover!  I honestly believe that they spent more time making an interesting looking cover than the movie.  I am sufficiently upset I wasted money renting this :(","978":"Well, I rented this flick just to see what it is like. The acting was non-existent. CGI effect was laughable. Plot was thin and predictable. The characters were a joke. The only good thing about this was Glori Anne Gilbert who portrayed the porn star one of the crew constantly fantasized about... OK, make that two good things... LOL! :)","979":"I grew up watching the X-Men cartoons, so I was disappointed to realize that they were going to try and make it real (so to speak). I really didn't enjoy this movie very much; they left off most of the better mutants (think Gambit and Beast) and the ones that were present weren't the same as in the cartoon.  Trust me, pass this one up (unless you aren't familiar with the cartoon--my husband never saw it, and he enjoyed this movie).","980":"I was hoping for something better, after reading and hearing about the movie as much as I did I came away somewhat disappointed.  I guess when we get X-Men 2 thru 10 we can look back and smile.  A great beginning if the series will continue.","981":"Sorry, but I just thought the movie was a complete BORE!  The effects are the only thing going for this kiddie-flick.  Better luck next time, guys.","982":"The Stranger is an interesting film, one of the better film noir of the era. This streaming version from Triad, described as \"remastered,\" is crap. Check out the other reviews. The MGM version has positive reviews.","983":"Buyer Beware! This so called collectors edition is a fake. The transfer is godawful, especially for such a high price and the special feature is non existent! While it is a fine fine film, it fell into the public domain and this company seems to have downloaded it from a VHS transfer and is now trying to scam the public into thinking it is a \"collectors edition\". Please don't buy this dvd!","984":"Amateurish and outdated by today's moviemaking standards, although the black and white photography with dramatic lighting is, indeed impressive.  The plot, however, has very serious logical flaws which renders it to the realm of the unbelievable.  Perhaps worth seeing for the nuanced performance of Edward G. Robinson--who, for some odd reason, looks exactly like Charlie Chan.","985":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen! Dont waste your money on this one.","986":"So what happened to Selma Blair's character? It is her search for self-discovery that spins Greg Kinnear's into all that follows for the rest of the film. Every role gets a development and conclusion -- except the lesbian? A filmmaker who starts something he can't handle shouldn't bother looking through the lens to begin with.","987":"disgusting.  Didn't get past the lesbo scene.  Who needs this?  One more time.... disgusting.  Why arent' there warnings BEFORE you buy a movie that there is gay content.  Not everyone wants to see it.","988":"This movie isn't bad...but it is not what the DVD cover makes it out to be.  It is not a comedy.  It is a drama with one or two funny lines.","989":"I went to see this in the theater and walked out. It was bad enough I wasted my money on a ticket I wasnt going to compound it by wasting another hour of my life. It was NOT romantic, definitely not funny and had nothing to do with love. The characters were either boring or totally unlikable.","990":"This movie costumes itself as a romance but is a closet tragedy.  Basic premise is that each human being no matter how blindly unaware or callous or vicious or unfeeling or lacking in principals or morality is basically nice and therefore all behavior is excused.  Do not waste your money or your time.","991":"I was disappointed by this DVD. Watching it, I got bored and just went on to other things. Sort of bothered by an apparent glorification of someone who really wasn't a very nice person.","992":"Definitely in the bottom five. The screen play strains to include the well-known historical points of its subject into the film in the most ham-fisted and contrived ways in an attempt to build a feature film length linear story. It fails heroically. The skeleton story is padded out with fabricated hokum, Hollywood star turns by Warren Beatty in possibly his most annoying performance ever, and gratuitous violence galore. If ever there was a must-miss it's this pile of garbage.","993":"as much as I dig Warren Beatty's work i can't get down with this film.only Harvey Keitel makes this film worth seeing.the only good thing that came out of this film was the union of Beatty&amp;Bening.very cliched Gangster  flick.Ok writing&amp;Directing but nothing special.","994":"I purchased this DVD because I love movies with Las Vegas settings.  I was excited to finally see the story of the visionary Bugsy and his dream of an upscale casino in Nevada.  I will not get into the numerous historical inaccuracies.  I expected the history to be screwed up; and it was, but I wanted a more accurate portrayal of Bugsy.  Beatty just gave off too much of a Woody Allen vibe for my taste.","995":"This movie is terrible trash.Mariah Carey  is the worst actress since Lindsay Lohan.  This movie is so bad it might supplant  \"Manos,The Hands of Fate\" as the worst movie  of all time.","996":"I used to wonder why it was poked at so much on Saturday Night Live, and now I know why.  I could not stay awake watching this movie, the acting was terrible. Good thing it was on TV, I'd NEVER take the time to rent it, let alone BUY it (just thinking of purchasing it makes my stomach turn).  The only reason it even made any money was because it was Mariah Carey's first movie. My opinion... stick to singing","997":"Aside from the poor acting, poor script, poor charcter developments, obvious fake N.Y. accents, lousy editing, terrible music, idiotic plot, I would say it belongs in the trash bin.","998":"Don't get me wrong- I like Mariah Carey. I thought the soundtrack to this movie was really good- shame the film didn't live up to it.  The storyline is weakly pathetic and the acting? You'll be laughing at Mariah's dismal messy performance!  It's clear that 2001 wasn't Mariah's year, let's hope she sorts her self out this year!","999":"i wasnt pleased with this item at all. the dvd doesnt even work so i would like to get my money back if possible.","1000":"Did not play well on my computer where I always play many of my DVD videos(def not a PC problem) but I had no problems playing on my home sorround system.","1001":"The production value, cast, acting, storyline, etc. of this were good and entertaining. The problem is the movie is more UNLIKE the book than it is like the book.  If you want to watch a movie of the book itself, you will want to look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001OSGR68\">The Count of Monte Cristo<\/a>","1002":"Great Sale, however it was not in very good condition bc there was writing on the DVD.","1003":"I enjoyed the movie and I purchased it to add to my dvd collection.  Unfortunately the particular disc I received from Amazon was flawed and unwatchable. Hope you have better luck.","1004":"I watched this movie with great anticipation after reading the book however, I quickly realized that this is not the same story that Dumas put on paper all those many years ago.  If you have never read his book it will entertain you.  It was entertaining but again it was not even close to the book.  It would be better titled \"Kinda like the Count...Cristo\".","1005":"I am not here to write about the movie... it's a good flick and worth owning.  However, the blu ray version would not play on my BD30K machine with the latest updates.  Not sure if it's the anti-copy protection or the poor implementation of blu ray from Sony.  Either way I can't watch it.","1006":"How come, when all the people get cut down in a full charge INTO a huge array of guns, Tom Cruise lives?  That's crap.  Anything to have a Hollywood, idiot ending, I guess.  It's a suicide charge, yet our guy goes back to his little darlin' afterwards.  What a load of crap!  Thanks.","1007":"Good American samurai movie, but the ending was totally hollywood. If you want to see a real samurai movie check out Azumi and aragami.","1008":"When I watch it at first time, I really respected of Samurai. Tom played as captain Algren who is fascinated by Samurai. It was very good film.But, we should not think that is like Japanese history, because the time when film set up and some buildings such as house, castle is different period of Japan.","1009":"i'm really suprised nobody saw the movie in the way I did. Ok, yes the movie has plenty of beautiful imagery, it showcases the samurai traditions, and it respects that. However, that's just scrating the surface. Dig deeper and you'll realize that what this movie is saying is - you need one white guy to save the country of Japan. I find it very condescending. The last samurai in this movie is Ken Watanabe's character, not Tom Cruise as the movie cover suggests.","1010":"The fight scenes in this movie were awesome. The historical themes were also very cool. But the dialogue was bad. Not the worst I've ever seen, but still pretty bad. This is not a movie I can watch over and over again.","1011":"I've watched Last Samurai in the theater before, and was entertained enough to come back for another look, this time on Blu-ray format. I remembered that it was shot in lush surroundings, and that warriors then were real warriors; not some big-shot general hiding behind some war room somewhere directing \"smart missiles\" etc. On the whole, it's a movie worth having around to please many different types of audiences; action-adventure, some historical basis, some romance & drama (though you do need to excuse a number of cheesy lines particularly towards the end).","1012":"To me this movie is purely entertainment. It's well worth watching. It has a good story. It's got great battle scenes. Some of the acting is excellent. Far better other actors in the film. Tom Cruise lends it his star power. Although, I would say his acting could have been more passionate. The costumes were exceptional. No Oscar contender. An epic film worth owning.","1013":"I dunno, i kinda though the acting was weak and the script was nothing new.  They really made up a lot of history for this one.  I couldnt help but think Americans would be offended if they made a movie about the revolution and put some Japanese guy in it as the hero.  I guess the music was pretty good, and it had some gread scenery, but i wouldn't watch it twice.","1014":"This movie can hold your attention, but historically it is somewhat inaccurate.  I also have a number of problems with the plot.  How does a non-samurai learn to be such a great swordsman in only a few short months when others spend the lives dedicated to this art and cannot even match his prowess?  Why is Cruise's character spared at the end?  If he has become a samurai, he would have been killed.  He is also a Gaijin, a foreign barbarian, and should be killed for this.  Oh, I forgot he is Maverick, not Goose.","1015":"Not right for the academy. It's not bad I here they shot it with digital. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Bette luck next time Tom","1016":"AN ARMY CAPTAIN [TOM CRUISE] GETS CAPTURED IN THE MIDST OF A BATTLE WITH THE CHINESE. EVENTUALLY, HE BEFRIENDS A SAMURAI WARRIOR [KEN WANTANABE] AND HE ENDS UP FIGHTING FOR THEIR CAUSE. THIS WELL-MEANING EPIC HAS EXCELLENT COMBAT SCENES AND GOOD ACTING TO SPARE, BUT IT JUST GOES ON TOO LONG. AND AFTER ABOUT THE FIRST 90 MINUTES OR SO, IT BEGINS TO GROW TIRESOME. BUT, IT RECOVERS TOWARD THE END. IF YOU LIKE THESE TYPES OF MOVIES, YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS. BUT, THE VIEWER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SEE SOME EXTREME VIOLENCE WHEN WATCHING THIS.","1017":"Its a good anime for a person with a short atenchen span or someone that gets bored esily. Very good idea but just way to short for me.","1018":"I wish I would have looked at all of the reviews closely.  The seller says nothing about this movie no longer having an active digital copy.  Since I bought the movie exclusively so that I could have the digital copy it was a \"let down\" when I discovered the fine print on the packaging.  DO NOT make the same mistake I made...If you are buying this for the digital movie insert - keep walking.","1019":"As action films go there is action.  That is fine for a big screen TV, but not worth the theater screen fare.  Honestly, T1 & T2 were the best in the series and should have stopped there.  All those that followed are just confused, inconsistent messes. Yep, the action is there but plot, story line, dialog, and acting are...well...never fluid.  This film with McG and Bale prove it.  If you want action it is here, if you are looking for rebirth of the franchise and substance...no it is not here.","1020":"The film Terminator Salvation, has some good points to it, and some bad points, as well. Plenty of action, good visual effects, we see more about the machines, John Connor's character, as an adult is more developed. Now, for some of the bad points, it's still the same Terminator story, being retold again, compared to the first two films, which were, fresh and original, when they came out. The other characters' in the film weren't so interesting, except, maybe, Marcus. The story isn't resolved by the end of the film, either.","1021":"For Terminator Fans, of which I am one, this was an entertaining movie.  It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening. It was the best of the recent man vs. machine genre movies.  There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things.","1022":"I have purchased several Blu-Ray movies through Amazon and I have always been very satisfied with the Delivery time and Quality of the Blu-Ray DVD's until I purchased this one, I ordered this Blu-Ray DVD at the same time I ordered 3 other Blu-Ray DVD's and this one took an extra 10 day's to arrive after I received the other 3 Blu-Ray DVD's.","1023":"Not near as good as I was hoping. Thought it would take place right after Sky-Net took over not some years down the line. I hope one day I'm good enough to twist a few wires on a car that has set for years and am able to start it within a minte or two. ;)","1024":"Christian Bale and Sam Worthington star in this 2009 sci-fi film. In 2018, John Connor rescues his father with a cyborg's help. This is pretty good and Christian is great as John. This dvd has nice picture and sound, but no extras. I still recommend this.","1025":"Lots of action, but terminator2 still the best. T1is a classic action film. Ok but not as great as previous terminators.","1026":"Movie does well on its own.  The sound on the blu ray is some of the best I've heard, Transformers1-2, Dark Knight, Iron Man, the picture is great but the movie looks a bit drab, it's meant to look like this I assume.  The director's cut is the best way to watch the movie as the original has some poor editing.  Kyle Reese is played well but I did not care for Moon Bloodgood.  Good not Amazing.","1027":"I guess I expected more from this movie after all the terminator series I've watched.  I just wasn't that impressed with it.  As always though there was great service from Amazon.","1028":"The special effects are really good.  Some of the story is good.  But overall, it seemed inconsistant with the other Terminators.  The ending was corny.","1029":"I fell asleep after about of hour of watching this movie....it was ok i guess looked great on blu-ray but as far as the movie goes....nowhere near as good as the other 3 terminator movies","1030":"didn`t think, i would ever say that. this edition is a joke. in the german version you get another complete skull head from a t-600 (like in the 6-disc edition) !!! and not just a face","1031":"How about getting James Cameron and Christian Bale together for a remake of The Terminator and burn the rest of the Terminator history. We can ask for a bad version with McG and Schwarz. The two respective groups fit perfectly together.","1032":"Terminator Salvation is the weakest of all the Terminator films, with one exception: Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright - he is terrific. He's even better in Avatar. And this year, he stars in Clash Of The Titans. Something to anticipate. Besides Wright, the film is pretty much just a lot of noise and special effects that don't add up to much. Even Christian Bale is the weakest I've seen him. It's almost as if he knows Wright is stealing the film away from him, and there's nothing he can do about it.  Waitsel Smith","1033":"In regards to DVD Extra's, you have to buy the 2-Disc Edition at Target. It has the same extra's as the blu-ray edition. So if you don't have a blu-ray player, go to target and get the movie there.","1034":"3 stars because I like the movie, but the Director's Cut is as the others have stated. Maybe 3 - 5 minutes of some added scenes but not enough to make it a movie changer. Personally I think they could've kept it at a PG-13 rating...","1035":"Nice Documentary\/video. Great for it's time but lacking by today's standards. Many scenes are reversed in the movie. Major flaw from the editors. Easily seen as the charging handles for rifles and sub guns are on the wrong side. It was a simpler time, did anyone notice back then?","1036":"The product quality is fine. I purchased this move to compare with \"The Fourth Kind\". Very Interesting similarities.","1037":"After watching, you ask yourself, did this really happen?  Frightening.  Christopher Walken is always worth watching.","1038":"Communion (Special Collector's Edition) (1989) was a three star production in this reviewers opinion.  Both Christopher Walken and Lindsay Crouse were excellent, but little else is noteworthy. I will say that the film had several near moments, but always came up short of what could have been done.","1039":"Is Strieber insane. Or is he making this crazy account up to sell books and inspire films? I'll have to say yes to the latter. However, don't let that dissuade you from a creepy film like Communion. Although, the plot is VERY disjointed there are very distubing scenes. Have you ever felt like an alien creature was creeping into your bedroom as you slept? Well, you will after seeing a scene that depicts exactly that. Memorably disturbing scenes of this nature give this otherwise uninteresting film a decent shelf life.","1040":"I remembered this as being a pretty good film or its genre when it first came out so I took a chance when I found it a good price. I wasn't disappointed, it is pretty silly but lots of fun if you take it for what it is pure science fiction with a second tier class of stars.  Molly Ringwald shows some of the talent that would make here such a success in her teen years.  It isn't Star Wars but it is fun.","1041":"It was basic, but the acting will pass. It still reminds me of a sort of Mad Max type film. Pure 1980's look and feel to it. It's worth renting and watching once if you are a Scifi fan.","1042":"Kind of like \"Mad Max\" in space. A sci-fi B movie but I find it entertaining. (But then I like Sci Fi B movies)","1043":"This was a good program, although I had hoped for more detailed content. Some segments are really interesting... others more mundane and have been done better on other DVDs.","1044":"I was very glad this movie didn't end up being a silly romance and break the couple up just to rekindle an old relationship! A good watch for a dull Saturday afternoon.","1045":"The opening credits (\"Wishin' and Hopin'\") and Rupert Everett are the only reasons to watch this movie. Everett not only looks good but is sympathetic and witty. The only word for the other male star is \"dumb.\" He looks dumb, he sounds dumb, he acts dumb.  There's a truly awful scene in which Cameron Diaz does a karaoke rendition of \"I Say a Little Prayer for You,\" humiliating herself and everyone else except her dumb fiance, who thinks she's adorable. Why Julia Roberts would have had the slightest interest in this guy is a mystery that is never solved.","1046":"Dont get me wrong.This isnt a bad film.its not a excellent one either. Julia roberts came across as pathetic,and a little unlikeable,as she tried to steal her best friend from his marriage to kimmy(cameron diaz).there are quite a few good scenes in this film.The restaraunt scene is very enjoyable,where the whole table erupts with singing. it is a very bitty film in my opinion,all over the place. dont expect a typical romance,because you will be sorely dissapointed.","1047":"Movie was cute and I only bought it because I'm a HUGE Dermot Mulroney fan.  I didn't like this as much as the Wedding Date.","1048":"The Bottom Line:  Though this 1997 Julia Roberts vehicle gets points for not following the oh-so-tired romantic comedy formula, My Best Friend's Wedding's willingness to go outside the norm unfortunately leaves it without a satisfying ending; it may be a commendable film, but it's not a very funny or rewarding one.  2.5\/4","1049":"Poor quality VHS.  Topic is superb, acting was excellent and the overall production was terrific.  Just the quality of the video wasn't up to my expectations.","1050":"Peter Brook omitted very important parts of the story. As children, the Kauravas plotted to kill the Pandavas, by luring them into a lac house and burning it down.  The Pandavas and their mother escaped and wandered in the forest for many years.  Before this occurred, Duryodhan poisoned Bhima and threw him into the sea, where Bhima was rescued by underwater creatures.  The Kauravas were treacherous, and this has not been pointed out by Peter Brook. Showing these events could have taken perhaps another ten minutes of screen time. This is a distorted story. S.K. Madireddi","1051":"My daughter (7.5) wasn't all impressed by this .. she didnt find it as enertaining or fun as other Barbie movies especially her favourite \"charm school\" ..","1052":"My daughter loves the Barbie DVD's, this one included, but I definitely think it's aimed towards an older audience than my 4 year old daughter.  That being said, she still highly enjoyed it (I think mostly because of the music) and it was worth every penny to see the smile on her face when she watched it.  I was disappointed by the graphics on it though.  The other Barbie movies appear to be made better than this one as far as the graphics go.","1053":"shows those avid barbie fans that growing up is sometimes hard but that things work out when you believe in yourself","1054":"I'm a teenager and I love Barbie movies! I also collect Barbies. I think that all of the previous, fantasy-like Barbie Movies are very nice. When i first heard the idea of this movie, I really didn't like the sound of the fact that it was going to have Barbie in school. I liked the storyline, and fantasy of the rest of the movies. It sort of makes little kids think the wrong things about high school; its all about liking boys, and you don't have to do school work, and you don't have to work hard.","1055":"the usual solid robert duvall performance in lonesome dove mode but still worth veiwing.my wife usually not a western fan  enjoyed the film","1056":"This movie takes place when the west was no longer as open as it had been or the Indians as wild. The plight of Chinese women sold into slavery is just as bad today as it was then? The filming and acting is great, but this version is kind of slow as westerns go. I liked it and enjoyed the history of the drive of horses across open country. The bad guys are really bad and the good ones are just kinda nice...","1057":"An interesting western but filled with nudity and actions that bring the quality  of he movie down. The acting was less than smooth.  Two cowboys save five chinese girls and have to take them cross country with them on their cattle drive.  I can't recommend this movie to any one.","1058":"This is an ok sequel. I wasn't all that impressed with the story line, and the action sequences left a lot to be desired. It also felt like it lacked some of the grit of the original. This just feels like a watered down let's ride the coattails of the original and see who we can get to buy it. That being said it's still better than a lot of the junk out these days and it was watchable.","1059":"Aesthetically amazing. Very beautiful gothic-style art. Fairly good dubbing.  The storyline however, is not extremely boring, but definitely nowhere near anything interesting. In truth, I believe everyone who thinks this movie was more than decent would not have, had the movie been animated as averagely as the storyline itself. Eye candy truelly often blinds persons from recognition of true perfection. Just about everyone likes this movie though, so be like them all, <p>VHD 1 = superior","1060":"I have to say that the graphics were extreme! I loved watching D's entrance! However, I am not so easy to please. I need a plot as well. Here I was disappointed. You can tell americans wrote this story. The plot was very weak and did not even come close to doing justice to 'Vampire Hunter D'. Hey, but the graphics were good...right?","1061":"No Ninja Scroll.the Talking hand was anoying and never explained.  if your a junky go for it.  if you just getting into anime like me than get ninja scroll or ghost in the shell.  Feel free to contact me if you dissagree","1062":"This film does more than scratch the surface regarding the band The Doors. However, it is far from comprehensive. The fact that some fiction was applied to the film was a bit disappointing. The heavy focus on Jim Morrison caused the other band members to be distant. It is essential viewing for any true Doors fan, but I have found books on this subject to be more informative. The film is reasonably entertaining, and the special edition interviews are good viewing.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author","1063":"DVD was delivered on time and in excellent condition.  From a historical perspective, this would be a good addition to one's DVD library for insight to Bob Hope and his personal relationships with the many Presidents of the United States outside of official business.","1064":"My daughter is learing her multiplying without knowing it..lol!!  She is addicted to all the songs and sings them all the time.  I sing them with her and they bring back memories of saturdays watching cartoons when i was her age.  A definate must for any school age child!!  Also has wonderful extras!!","1065":"I loved looking at the old school rock but the sound was very low and we had to be very quiet in order to hear it.","1066":"I use to watch this on saturday mornings and loved it! but i got this and dont remember it being so BORING! Im hoping my daughter will find the enjoyment like I did years ago. I guess because Im older cartoons bore me alot. lol","1067":"Most school do not teach this any more, it's imforamtion for all student's. I would buy more educational dvd's from Schoolhouse Rock","1068":"The product arrived in record time; however, it was not what I expected, and that's not Amazon's fault.  I already own the VHS copy of the Top 25 Schoolhouse Rock songs, and thought I was missing something.  Sadly I was not.  The only positive is that the Multiplication Rock portion of it will help my daughter learn her multiplication tables much faster through song.","1069":"Brings back memories, but not as entertaining as I thought it'd be. My wife was put off by some of the phrases she thought sounded insensitive.","1070":"My son lost interest after 20 minutes,while my daughter watched longer, it made her go to sleep.","1071":"I haven't given the gift yet","1072":"Very cheesy fight scenes, and an even more simplified plot.  The \"big\" special technique used at the end looked like a cheerleader pyramid.  Would def. not suggest this movie to anyone unless you are into really old kung fu flicks.","1073":"I was hoping there would be more on Katy Perry instead of two or three people talking about her that I didn't even know.  That is not my idea of a good DVD.  I love to watch Katy, but they had very little of Katy in the DVD.","1074":"Only in New York could a cross-dressing, female opera impersonator rise to the top of the club scene in the late '70s, riding on a wave of the era's fascination with everything twisted and fetish.  Nomi's sad, short life and the despicable way he treated his band are profiled, and seeing the live footage of him after all this time one is left to wonder: what were we thinking???  As one of the earliest casualties of AIDS he became emblematic, in a way that, perhaps, was not entirely to his disliking.","1075":"Good \"novela\", however, wish that it was not so chopped up.  If you did not watch it on Univision, then you would be lost.  I thought I was purchasing the \"novela\" in its original verision.","1076":"THe second cd at the end it was blurry and could not see the end of it.  I probably will return the tape for another one.  I did not know that the cd's were tape on both sides, it was a bit confusing.","1077":"This is one of my all time favorite novelas. I'd been looking for it for a while with no luck. When I finally found it here, I was so excited I ordered it right away... I made a mistake, they cut off so much! It seems like they're just a bunch of small clips put together. So dissapointed, I would've definately paid the extra money to get the WHOLE story!","1078":"The novela Rubi in itself is excellent.  The theme was fascinating and the actors and actresses were fabulous.  With that said having the opportunity to purchase it and watch it while stationed overseas with no spanish channels is thrilling.  I am no expert in film but thought it was well put together and easy to follow even if some scenes of the TV version were missing.  Definitely a must watch for anyone interested in spanish soaps.","1079":"I knew about how Red Dragon was the first of the Hannibal trilogy, so I bought it.  When I had finished reading it, I loved it and decided to rent the DVD.  Well, it wasn't very good.  It was well acted, well directed, but the writing ....  They changed a really good ending from the book to a ... one in the movie.  So if you thought the movie was just OK, and your a huge Silence of the Lambs fan, then read the book!","1080":"Could have been much better if they would have been more aligned with Harris'Red Dragon.  It would have made for a much better ending.  In addition, &quot;the Tooth Fairy&quot; would have surpassed Buffalo Bill in sure creepiness if the Red Dragon would have been emphasized greater.","1081":"This film was entertainig with credible performances from the cast howevever it neglects to capture the viewers undivided attention such as &quot;The Silence Of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;.  The story itself is definately more intriguing than the proceeding two films but the movie fails to deliver much insight into the villians character compared to the novel it was adapted from.  I could also do without the cheesy 80's music soundtrack blaring in the backround.  This is not a must for your DVD collection.  I recommend renting it before you buy it.","1082":"A well made suspence-thriller on a low budget. Absolutely worth your time...","1083":"For the Amazon reviewer to state that Manhunter is \"arguably even better\" than Silence of the Lambs is sheer idiocy and should immediately disqualify him from further reviews.  Manhunter is not even in the same league.  Apart from some good performances, the story is poorly told and not even particularly compelling.  Silence of the Lambs blows this movie away.","1084":"A 50 year old secret kept hidden from everyone is about to ruin Coleman Silk's life. Slow to get going, it does finally show a couple brief skin scenes near the end, notably one of Nicole Kidman. It was a worth a rental.","1085":"I knew nothing about the movie before I saw it. I Thought it'd be some thriller, and I was wrong. Even though it's no thrill, it's still good.  Good acting and an interesting plot. A little long, but it moves along smoothly.","1086":"I liked the movie very much, as I believe it is okay to be patriotic and fly the flag.  Where did this Jim Emerson come from?  Do we have to be subjected to reviews by far-left-leaning, gun-hating, anti-Reagan Liberals?  I realize reviews are subjective, but I don't care to be bludgeoned with someone's political views such as I felt I was with Mr. Emerson's review.","1087":"I've been watching Cold War movies from this era and this is the worst of the bunch (The Day After, War Games, Testament,  Threads: England's Day After). But I think some of the reviewers here is taking this too seriously. I found it entertaining enough if it is implausible. I have no idea what the writers were thinking when they made it or the actors either. It was just another \"good guys against the bad guys\" movie to me. Get some popcorn and enjoy the show. It's just a movie.","1088":"The pacing at the start of this anime is fantastic.  The story is interesting.  I'd give the first half of this anime five stars.  Then things just start to get dumb.  It really should have ended with the showdown between the two main antagonists in the first half of the series.","1089":"Did anyone else find it extremely ironic that a huge picture of Near graces the top of the packaging for the Mello figurine? It's easily 3 times as large as poor Mello. Given the relationship between Near and Mello in the series, I can only assume that the manufacturers were feeling particularly sadistic that day.  Perhaps, in the spirit of things, we should have Light's giant face featured on the packaging for L's figurine.","1090":"DEATHNOTE WAS GREAT UNTIL L DIED. THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE ENDED WITH LIGHT WINNING. AT LEAST THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT THE CRAP DUO THAT IS MELLOW AND NEAR.","1091":"This movie is okay. Its low budget, but the story line is great! I would rent it first before I buy it. Its based on a true story!","1092":"This item was delivered on time and in excellent condition. The actress who played Carmen was exciting and dangerous - just like the \"carmen\" character is supposed to be. I think she was the most interseting character in the movie.","1093":"The selection of programs didn't fit the title.  Only three of the programs involved Christmas and a couple weren't worth the time to watch. On the good side, the product was received in excellent condition and played without difficulty.","1094":"final season was so- so. the best seasons was 1-7, than after that was so-so, and smallville didn't go out on a high note","1095":"It shipped fast but product was cheap looking. The box never closed properly. Probably won't buy from this place again.","1096":"After hating season 9, I was hoping 10 would make up for it.  It didn't.  It was ok, but not enough to make up for the rest.  Wishing now I had never bought ANY of the seasons.","1097":"This movie is okay. Its low budget, but the story line is great! I would rent it first before I buy it. Its based on a true story!","1098":"I don't know how to explain it, but my children LOVE this movie.  Maybe it's that Thomas is so obviously steaming in the wrong direction, making mistakes and being prideful, but it works on a level that gets through to kids.  My son got the movie and wooden Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand as a birthday present.  The whole family has watched it.  Torture for adults to watch, but the little ones LOVE it.","1099":"This DVD is ok. I agree with the other shoppers that Hero of the Rails was much better. The only thing that I liked about this one is that its a full lenght movie, better for car long rides that the shorter episodes DVDs.","1100":"This installment of the new Thomas CGI character versions was just OK. Its the storyline and writing that's not great, like they really rushed the script through to capitalize on Hero of the Rails and get extra product out in time for Xmas. Its clear that HIT entertainment is fully and completely out for the buck like Disney, exploiting whatever life is left in this franchise.  That's the adult view.  The kids view? My son still loves it and its taken over the #1 spot on the blu ray player. Its all about the characters for him.","1101":"Not bad.  A zombie movie wrapped in an alien movie.  The plot line was a little corny at times and the subplot was kind of predictable, but in all, it was pretty well done.","1102":"Engaging when focusing on the kids and their growth and understanding with the complexities of the adult world. Less so when it was an action movie (most of the last half).  Not just nostalgic for a way of life, but for a kind of filmmaking, one that put story over spectacle. Which is ironic, since it's the spectacle that prevents Super 8 from being a classic.","1103":"I was expecting more out of this film by the minds that created the film, but I was dissappointed. It was missing something and it ended to quick. Although it is a pretty neat sci-fi story thats never been done.","1104":"This is a better than average timewaster. The train wreck scene is very intense, nicely done.The kid acting was good, reminded me of the Little Rascal movies. Not a great movie, maybe worth the $4 SD or $5 HD viewing fee.","1105":"I didn't know much about Super 8 going in - other than it was directed by JJ Abrams. It was a fun film, and there were great performances by the child actors. Def. worth a watch.","1106":"Very simple predictable plot, well acted but that's about it. If you like Spielberg's work you will probably enjoy this one. But I wish I hadn't wasted two hours on this one.","1107":"Great combo of danger, shoot 'em up, explosion and... heart. Perfect Abrams\/Speilburg combo. The playback was rough toward the end.","1108":"This movie makes you think especially if you like continuity problems.  I expected perfection from Abrams and Spielberg.  You can sit back, like in Mystery Science Theater 3000, and criticize for a couple of hours with little rest.  If these numerous minor problems are overlooked it is enjoyable.  Be forewarned, the audio is very low but the action scenes are extremely loud so be prepared.","1109":"good teen movie and even for 12 year olds . older adult may enjoy it to . its a monster found by the usa government who escapes  specil effects are good actors are good and will the story kinda lacking but worth seeing or buying","1110":"I thought this movie started out great, but then got a little cartoonish. I liked it and at the same time wish it was a better story.","1111":"Children will probably like this movie a lot more then most adults. Also I agree with other reviewers that a number of scenes are so dark that you can't see what the actors are seeing. I could say a lot more, but just as my title to this review states \"Worth watching once\" I would rather spend that time watching a better movie","1112":"Super 8 is mildly entertaining....but like most Spielberg flicks... there is a fair amount of cheese involved and it is rather predictable if you have seen his other movies.","1113":"This movie had great promise. Elle Fanning's performance almost balanced out the formulaic plot. If I'd had stopped watching at the halfway point I would have given it five stars. The second half deserves one. Average score is therefore three stars.","1114":"It seemed as though the formula for some great films from my past replaced the film half way through the film leaving me with an empty feeling at the films conclusion.","1115":"I wanted to like this b\/c I like Abrams & Spielberg. The movie was just ok for me, I wouldn't buy it. It's like a modern day E.T.","1116":"Expected alot more plot to it. The children actors were amazing for them to act like kids and not scripting it. Truly wasn't what I expected from the trailers and waiting for it to be released after the theaters. Only good acting, kept me from not ending the movie.","1117":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004EPYZQ2\">Super 8 (Two-Disc Blu-ray\/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)<\/a>  Movie was great however there happened to be a section of the blu-ray that would not play properly. It seemed like to much of a hassle to return movie.","1118":"Good as advertised.  Arrived promptly and in the specified condition. I was not sure at first but I had previously viewed this movie at some time earlier.","1119":"I loved this movie up until about half way. Me being a movie collector I of course purchased it, but I was a bit disappointed with it still. It had SO MUCH potential! But still worth it to own, great sci fi flick.","1120":"This is a good sci-fi movie, about some teenagers making a zombie movie when a huge train accident occurs and these little white cubes get thrown around everywhere.  Next thing you know, the U.S. Air Force is grabbing up everything.  Is there something they want to hide??? (Hint--could be!)  \"Do not speak of this, or they will KILL you. . . and your parents!\"  A Stephen Spielberg production, filmed in West Virginia.  Don't forget to watch the credits at the end for a little extra show.","1121":"I just watched the Super 8 movie and found it to be of great interest and entertaining. Without going into specifics, it really is a movie dealing lives of younger teens, an alien, the local town with its population experiencing havoc from the USAF military trying to catch the alien.   An ideal film for children and adults or the entire family.","1122":"This movie is a combination of E.T,Close encounters of the third kind and independence day all tricked out with with modern day effects.Lack substance and is fairly predictable.A one time watcher not a keeper.Better of renting.","1123":"This movie was a nostolgic, but uninspired mash up of older summer blockbusters like Cloverfield, Stand By Me, and ET. The characters were transparent and under developed, the alien monster completely unfrightening and non-threatening, the plot loosely tied together. When the movie mercifully ended, I was left thinking \"Is that it? really?\".  I can't award half stars, but I would give it a 2.5.","1124":"I thought Dakota Fanning was to be in this movie. Maybe I am thinking of another movie. While it had a lot of action, it was kind of boring to me. I think teens or 24 year olds will like this, I didn't.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004EPYZPS\">Super 8<\/a>","1125":"Good little monster movie. But instead of a monster movie with kids you get a kid's movie with monsters. Good for a view or two, it keeps you interested to the end. As another reviewer stated...its 75% kids and 25% monster.","1126":"This is truly the love-child of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg.  It is half-Cloverfield, half \"The Goonies\".  Too bad that between the two of them they couldn't think of anything original to do.  On the upside, lots of noisy things blow up.  It is not bad American cinema; in fact, it's quite good, in the same way that a Big Mac is good American cuisine.","1127":"this is what i call SO SO. it took very very long for the action to begin, like maybe one hour, there was action before but then return to the blah blah blah...anyway it was entertaining but SO SO","1128":"This movie was a tiny bit better than I was expected. It's like a watered down Stephen King story. The monster\/alien was pretty cool looking. It's big reveal was similar to that of Jaws, they didn't show it until the middle of the movie. In the early 80's, a few friends are making a zombie movie with a Super 8 mm camera. When a train derails, an alien breaks loose and creates havoc on the town. I'd probably recommend SUPER 8!!!","1129":"Good special effects with a so-so story.  Fair overall.  It's not the usual quality you'd expect for a Spielberg production.","1130":"It won't disappoint. Captures the magic,but could have used better lighting to expose and dwell on the creature longer.  After all it was a high dollar production.","1131":"I never became enthralled with this movie, and was disappointed after the hype.  Some of the major players were simply too cliched to be allowed, and I never felt much attachment for the creature.  Better luck next time.","1132":"This was a ok movie with a weird plot. My children and I watched it and we are were a little confused sometimes, but it is worth looking at a second time (maybe).","1133":"We thought the acting was good.  The special effects especially during the train crash were enough to make you sit up straight in your seat. After the train crash, the movie got more and more incredible.  With the writer producer team of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg we really expected a movie in the ET class - it was NOT.  The thing that bothered me most is that depicting the US military as the villain is a movie ploy that is shabby and has gotten threadbare with repeated use.  We just expected better.","1134":"Nothing really new or amazing here.  An alien escaped a train car and some kids found out about it.  Now they try to uncover the mystery behind the disappearances of local townspeople.  I felt like I was treading heavily through some of the cheesy, emotional plot.  I was entertained; however, and eager to learn more about the alien.","1135":"these are older westerns but are still very cool to watch. many in the vein of Clint Eastwoods westerns. i enjoyed quite a few of these 20 movies. the picture quality is good and theres lots of action. i recommend.","1136":"A collection of Westerns with some good and bad movies.  Most of the movies are older and some have lower quality pictures and soundtracks as well.","1137":"Is it still.. 1998? Where's the Blu Ray release of this amazing show? It's fairly obvious Ozzy has some type of effect on his voice to sound double tracked but it's darn effective and I wonder why he didn't use it more often..this is a buy but would be a MUST BUY for double the price on Blu Ray. How did $haron mi$$ thi$ opportunity?","1138":"I just purchased this video. This is NOT the Speak of the Devil album. Maybe the tour (1982), but the original album was recorded at The Ritz in New York. Just look at the song listing! I was very bummed. I have been waiting for the real concert since 5th grade. This is a great video, don't get me wrong, but claiming it is the Speak of the Devil show is incorrect and misleading!!!!!!!!!!","1139":"I bought a new season 1 set that is supposed to come with a lot of little neat extras. there were no extras and the dvd cases were broken allowing the dvds slide around in the cases. the dvds themselves work fine but the total package wasn't as high a quality as i expected.","1140":"one the whole its not a bad film but it far from the best of laural and hardy films but if your a real fan you wont be that disapointed.  HOWEVER....DURING THE FILM I DID NOTICE A SLIGHT DELAY IN THE SYNC WITH THE  SOUND OF THE FILM!","1141":"The Lucy show DVD set was cheap. There were no official air dates of each episode, which would be good information for fans, and the episodes were not restored much, and, all of the episodes are out of order...like the first 4 are in color, and then theres one from the first 3 seasons, in black and white...I'd wait for a better edition DVD package unless you're a diehard fan, but, on the record, they picked some fairly good episodes for this 10 episode DVD 2 pack! The shower episode, Lucy takes vacation and new roommate episodes were great!","1142":"If you truly like this movie..take the time to read the book. You will find its not as charming as the movie and the abuse and harm he caused was of great concern. He is a genius, but it was not a goverment caused stress..it was plain and simple mental illness.  Their wedding was not all rainbows and unicorns..they were divorced for many years while he was locked up or traveling aboard. He was selfish and drained his mothers and family's finances. Read the book to find out how it really was.","1143":"But, it deviated so much from true events. Ron Howard should have respected Mr. Nash's life, and not attempt to make this a moral story of triumph over mental illness. The biography is much more interesting. I recommend the book.","1144":"a bispic of the meteoric rise of john forbes nash jr , a math prodigy able to solve problems that baffled the greatest minds. and how he overcame years of suffering through schizophernia to win the nobel prise. be warned you will be board for at least half this film","1145":"This is a fine movie, a good film, watchable, enjoyable, entertaining and, at times, informing.  What it is not is groundbreaking, compelling, affecting or, simply, great.<p>Russel Crowe's performance was typically good, but nowhere near his stunning turn in The Insider.  In this movie he is playing the troubled genius, and there's really nothing all that new to his performance.<p>Beyond Russel Crowe, everything else is sort of facile.  Technically well executed, the film simply doesn't have the impact that many of it's reviews--and accolades--would seem to indicate.","1146":"The protagonist John Nash,a mathematic genius,is so talented that he increasingly becomes pshycotic.During the movie the viewer becomes more and more confused and will not be able to understand &quot;A BEAUTIFUL MIND&quot; straightaway.That is the reason for just 3 out of 5 stars.Russel Crowe presents in an amazing way the illness of John Nash.To my mind you have to see the movie at least twice to understand this masterpiece. My recommandation:do not despair during the movie because in the end you will check it all.It is worth to see it,but not a must.","1147":"I bought this movie because everybody was saying it was good but when I saw it I thought it was long and boring I mean in order to see it you need a dictionary to understand each word they say in it or be really smart , but what I found interesting was the twist which fooled me and I like it because how it was presented. The dvd has lots of stuff for you to watch which is pretty good but thats about it.","1148":"A pretty good movie.  Outstanding performances by everyone, but a kind of &quot;so what?&quot; articulation of Nash's story.  I think it would have had more impact if we had seen more of both his genius (not the BS with him doing nonsensical stuff, but actually doing math relating to his theory that won the Prize) and his illness.  The movie at a minimum should have given more information about Nash's unique contribution to Mathematics.  All told, it got about 2 minutes, as compared to the amount of time given his hallucinations.","1149":"There are quite a few things wrong with this movie but it still holds the attention without being irritating. Fans of Westerns will probably find it interesting.  The DVD is quite good although excessively grainy in some shots. Colours are good, the images are strongly focused and the sound is clear and clean.","1150":"I remember this one. We were given 3-D glasses going into the theater and were told, \"When the guy in the movie puts HIS mask on, put on YOURS!!\" Needless to say, there were plenty of BOOO!!! moments. Kind of suspicious of how it will look now. But back then.........if you're into nostalgia and remember this, then buy it. If not, you might e=want to pass.","1151":"I don't know what's up with this release...the DVD I got says nothing about included 3D glasses, and indeed there are NONE.  I went to the manufacturer's website, and the same basic DVD cover is displayed, except theirs says, \"3d glasses included\" right on the front (mine doesn't)...weird.  I see another reviewer here claims their copy came with one pair...who knows?  Video quality is a little hazy, but overall probably an improvement over VHS.  Best 3D is achieved when viewed on a computer monitor.","1152":"A definite for a Lucky Dube fan - the sound and picture are both very good. The music is good, but the band seems a bit tight - almost like they are very aware of the camera and don't want to screwup. That, or they were told to play it by the numbers. There is very little spice or improv to the music, particularly with the drumming.","1153":"I read your comments that said English subtitles before I bought this dvd.  But there is no English subtitles for deaf people.  I know this movie is good but I have a hard time to understand what people said.","1154":"Not the feel good type that I was looking for.  Some may like it, but not me.","1155":"low budget entry in the AFTER DARK HORRORFEST gets credit for its avoidance of stereotypical characters and effective camera work to compensate for its low budget.  its cast of unknowns is very effective and the sense of doom is disturbing.  its not your typical zombie flick and is above average, albeit a little bleak in its ending.","1156":"I just munch this type of movie up but i was still left wanting something else to eat. The movie seemed to take forever as far as getting something going here. Once it did, it was hard to make scenes out due to the darkness in the film and the acting was just ok but for some reason, I just could not give it a two star. The movie did have its scary moments and i am glad i did purchase the DVD at a cheap rate.","1157":"8 films to die for i was a lil dissappointed with this one rats umm i dunno what to say rent this one it was ok not great and not terrible worthy to rent red box!!","1158":"This is a pretty good movie but, it has a \"been there done that\" feel to it. The actors do a good job with what they have to work with and the movie captures the time period without making it look too ridiulous. Swimming as a sport to watch, is like watching paint dry so, that doesn't help the film either. It's worth a look if you see it on cable, as the based on a true story film does inspire you...a little.","1159":"Ok, here it is. I am a huge fan of Abbott and Costello movies. Africa  Screams is a decent one and has many funny moments but its not their best.  Jack and The Beanstalk is ok but thats about it. You won't go wrong  watching these movies though. So, on this DVD double feature i went Ape and  Not Giant if you get my drift. Ape for Africa Screams and throw out the  magic beans for Jack and the Beanstalk. 3 stars is all i could give!","1160":"one the whole its not a bad film but it far from the best of laural and hardy films but if your a real fan you wont be that disapointed.  HOWEVER....DURING THE FILM I DID NOTICE A SLIGHT DELAY IN THE SYNC WITH THE  SOUND OF THE FILM!","1161":"The version I received was a Taiwanese version dubbed in Mandarin and not in Cantonese. There are commentaries in Cantonese but the movie is dubbed in Mandarin. I like the movie but I wanted it in Cantonese.","1162":"I found this to be an entertaining movie but not one of Chow's best. There were many references to Kung Fu Hustle as well as Shaolin Soccer which were funny but overall the story was lacking. It's a fun movie but not the greatest. I'd say rent it.","1163":"Different from Stephen Chow's other films (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), CJ7 is an alright, fun one and a half hour family friendly experience.  It takes some getting used to, however since it's a family film and on top of that, Chow doesn't really play the main character. Plus not a whole lot of kung-fu action...  Yeah the CGI effects are cheesy but all in all a light-hearted somewhat touching film. It's not a must-see Stephen Chow film but if you're looking for something to watch when you're bored - CJ7 will suffice.","1164":"i bought this movie cause i was told that it was good....it was ok.  Not bad for 5 bucks i spent.  the story is very good but it has some of the same bull that most run of the mill horror movies have.  the don't go in there parts are stupid cause any reasonable person would not do some of the stupid stuff the girl does.  im a big fan of criminal minds and it kinda reminded me of the show.","1165":"Violent, bloody, gory - and not very well done. Sorry. This film is a prequel to Stevan Mena's first film, Malevolence, another not that great movie, both are about psycho killers, typical slasher movie stuff. The concept itself is interesting - a character study on how a psychopathic killer is crafted under the tutelage of another psychopathic character, but I'm always leery of movies that are directed, produced, written, and even scored by one person - if there's no one around to tell y ou \"No\" - how do you know you're not making crap?","1166":"This story is low on the horror, high on the gore.  Strange on the morality, even the folks who don't smoke or have sex end up poorly.  The acting was okay.  The cinematography was not so bad.  The story was rural, limited, and the set up for a sequel is weak at best.  I cannot recommend this movie.","1167":"It fulfills the contract for a sequel and maybe a third spin off will come from it. The movie was a B-","1168":"I didn't see the first movie so missed some of the back story.  Exceptional acting here and very touching performance by Janet Jackson.  Good values and practical information for marrieds.  Tyler Perry is a master at what he does - all different things - and this is one of the best.","1169":"did not like the way it ended the first one why did i get married was much better and i did not like the way it eneded.","1170":"success sprouts triteness with rapidly produced projects.  Perry needs to go back to the drawing board","1171":"I gave it three stars because Janet Jackson was good. 5 stars for her.3 stars for her and the whole movie. Tyler Perry is using the same material. Nothing changed. Angela in the airport acting like a fool was really dumb. But Janet was awesome. I loved her. Other than that I can do without.","1172":"The Movies are Great classics and that is the only reason I did not send them back. They could had done a better job on recording to the DVDs. Video and Audio Quality was some what ok on 2 or 3 movies, but even then they looked as if they use no Contrast,and a continually alot of spotty snow, crackle audio.","1173":"I was a little disappointed by the brevity and lack of substance or suspence. But these movies were made a long time ago and I did enjoy seeing the great stars from that era.","1174":"Consistently beautiful and interesting composition and staging. Completely unengaging on an emotional level. I found myself often appreciative of what I was seeing but caring not at all about what I was watching.","1175":"The Bottom Line:  It cannot be denied that Bertolucci knows his way around a camera, but this mash up of fascism and sexuality never manages to be interesting or engaging; I went into this film expecting something near a classic and instead found a movie that threatened to put me to sleep.  2.5\/4","1176":"This is one of the great European films, and it's just great that it has been given an almost proper release, BUT, there are HUGE bright YELLOW subtitles almost right in the MIDDLE of the screen. Why? This makes the film almost unwatchable. They are so OBTRUSIVE it is almost better watching the dubbed version. Don't buy this. Wait and see if there is a less horrible version released in Europe.","1177":"I enjoyed Clouseau as always.  I was glad to add this DVD to my collection.  The service was also good.","1178":"It's a funny movie, though funny-stupid. It's the parody of couple of the movies, which makes it even more interesting and funny. \"I know what you did last summer\", \"Scream\", and \"The Matrix\" are couple of the movies that you might recognize while watcing Scary movie. It's dumb, but it's funny. You don't have to think a lot while watchig it. Fun to watch with a group of people.","1179":"i liked this movie alot, but there were some things that were boring and sexual. If you want a funny movie this is it, but be ready for some R scenes. WARNING: dont let this movie fall into a 10 or unders hands, it might be too much. there were some bare laughs but its a (dirty) movie sorta. This movie is not scary!","1180":"This would be a great movie to watch with a large group of people. THere are far too many, shall we say, disgusting parts to actually sit down and watch this one on your own. While Scary Movie does have its moments (The I know what you did last summer (or Halloween) scene is great), there are enough other problems to overshadow the funny parts. Had they left out most of the sex jokes, it would have been a much better movie.","1181":"i thought it was very crude and disgusting, but kinda funny in a way. like, for example, i don't think that a guy shoving his penis through another guy's ear or someone taking a pic of a guys small penis is funny. but i think that a woman trying to get through a whole in a garage door is funny, lol. but i guess it was alright. i give it 3-1\/2 stars","1182":"Scary Movie, definitely cleaner than its sequel, has its funny parts and its idiotic parts...The first 15 to 20 minutes is hilarious, but the rest of the film just has bits and pieces that are funny. Little of the raunchiness is funny, but you kind of have to laugh for its failed attempt...Scary Movie rates 3 out of 5 for its effort and its 15 minutes of fame...otherwise this film is poor...","1183":"This is definitely a film aimed at teenagers and students. I've seen worse, it was fairly funny in places, but don't expect anything too much. One to watch with friends when your bored.","1184":"This movie makes you laugh histarically, but it's jokes are somewhat repititious and if you see this movie more than 3-4 times, you get bored.","1185":"Every genre has it's spoof so it should come as no surpirse that 'Scary Movie' was made.  If not for the writing talents of the Wayan's Brothers it could have been much worse, but at least it manages to be entertaining.  The DVD offers some nice behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes which make purchasing the film worthwile.  All in all, it's worth purchasing (if you have a coupon).","1186":"I have to give this a okay rating.  It was not a terrible movie but it's nothing ground breaking or great.  I was mostly interested in this movie because of the drinks.  The acting and dialogue can get pretty bad in this movie.  But if you enjoy a &#34;bar film,&#34; this is not a bad one.  Considering it's from the 80s, it is a good movie but there are other bar films that top this.","1187":"not sure what the problem is, or if its even the fault of the actual dvd, but the picture quality is pretty awful.  its grainy, and dark.  i get a better picture when im' watching something on regular tv, on a station that is NOT HD.  other than that, it was delivered quickly which was nice, just the quality has bummed me out a bit...","1188":"This movie brings back so many wonderful memories of my cousin, sisters and I singing along, just being silly! Great movie...one of the VERY few roles I think he did well at: it let him \"channel\" his ADHD!!! Great though!!!","1189":"One of the better of the F&F series, but it's like watching Ocean's Eleven (2001) on steroids. Plenty of action, but more shoot 'em up than the rest of the series. I guess you got to have lots of shooting with \"The Rock\" in a movie. Probably in his contract. Anyhow it's fast and bloody, so it will be a big hit. Look forward to the next one, since the ending shows a tease about who comes back from the dead next time.  Nothing else to say that already hasn't been said. Good movie, but not fantastic.","1190":"A great set-piece and stunt near the beginning of the movie and a marvelously destructive chase scene at the end but nothing much between the two events.  Fans of the franchise will no doubt be well pleased.  Fans of knuckle-headed action movie can probably find better stuff to waste their time on.  'A-Team' for example was a much better knuckle-headed waste of time.","1191":"I had heard pretty good things about this movie; that it was by far the best of the series etc....It really wasn't that good.  It was ok, for an action movie, but not worth the $20 for a blu ray.","1192":"Though I bought and downloaded the HD version, the portable copy that I moved to my Galaxy Tab 10.1 is so grainy Toreto looked like bald Mario on Atari. I suggest Amazon would offer a variation of movie video screen size formats to match with a portable player, not just \"one screen size fits all\".","1193":"The movie was fantastic but,has horrible language in it.You can't see a good action movie anymore without it saying offensive language and it was a dissapointment.","1194":"The movie was excellent thats really the reason I bought it.  However it did not come with its original case which I really hated.  I collect movies and without the case it was pointless buying it from this buyer.","1195":"The animation doesn't flow very smoothly, but the music is wonderful.  My daughter was still singing the songs weeks after we returned this video to the rental store.  She has been asking for it for her birthday. (4 years  old) Followed the story fairly closely. Talking animals add to the fun.","1196":"This was a movie we rented through Amazon\/Roku because Netflix didn't have it.  Interesting to have movie Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) in scenes with TV Oscar Madison (Jack Klugman) where Felix is the drunk and Oscar is the voice of sobriety.  Not great (a little Alcoholics Anonymous preachy and the characters aren't terribly likable), but a nice cheap evening.","1197":"Put in metaphorical terms, this movie is the equivilant to &quot;ny-quil&quot;. It's like, why see this when you can see &quot;Howard's End&quot;.  They're both the same movie, it's just that  Howard's End is a whole lot better.  Take about your snooze fest! Whoa is  this film slow, boreing and bothersome! The 3 stars are for Emma, Anthony,  and the money this movie saved me on sleeping pills.","1198":"Mickey Rourke does a fine job making a P.I. look like an amoral thug. DeNiro supports as a client beyond reproach with a somewhat aloof demeanor.  There is murder, mayhem, voodooism, blood-letting, cannibalism, incest, brutality, and assorted other barbarisms. It does what it sets out to do rather successfully. You might find the foregoing colorfully filmed acts artfully accomplished and intriguing to experience as necessary fulfillment of the creative staffs concept. You might find them off-putting and good reason to eject the disc. In any case, be aware that this is not Sam Spade, the Thin Man or Marlowe.","1199":"2 Headed Shark Attack is a creature feature that is obviously trying to cash in on the minor success of Piranha 3D. And it's not a bad movie, but it lack the bloody shock value of Piranha. There is gore, but it's not over the top. If you like Sy-Fy original movies, you should check it out though, as it's better than a lot of the movies shown on the Sy-Fy Channel. And it's got Carmen Electra looking 20-something at 39.","1200":"This is the 3rd of 4 Dick Tracy movie serials, as usual it features Ralph Byrd as Tracy, and that is pretty much where the similarity between the serials and the comic strip end.  And in typical serial fashion there are fights galore, lots of chasing, but it's all good fun, if you are interested in the Tracy serials, this wouldn't be the one to start with.  For some extra fun keep count of how many hats Dick loses throughout the 15 chapters!","1201":"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.<p>This film which is one of several involving the character Lemmy Caution remains popular to this day as one of the few science fiction films with no special effects. It is a good view of a technocratic society an has elements which at the time seemed like fantasy but in our computer age seems more feasible.<p>The film also has a voice over that is really deep and raspy that sounds very interesting.<p>The DVD does not have any special features but still is a good one to buy.","1202":"Both the music and DVD quality are good, well above average.  At first, I didn't find Dave's talking in between songs much of a problem.  By the end of the DVD, I realized that it had become a distraction for me and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the concert.","1203":"After hearing tons of recordings and live performances by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with this album. They seemed very unenthusiastic.  I was so excited to listen to it only to be very disappointed and I have only listened to it a few times, guess I'll sell it used on here!  If you want a great CD check out Into the Wild Soundtrack by Eddie Vedder!","1204":"Purchased this Blu-ray to test out my new hardware and it certainly shines, great sound and good looking video make this a true reference disc. The performance however, is not on par with the Luther college gig, and make no mistake, this is not the DMB so some may be dissapointed with the content. My biggest gripe though, is with Dave's inane babel between songs. This guy really needs to stick to the music and put a cork in it, kinda ruined the experience for me. Hey, maybe let Tim do the talking!","1205":"I'm a big Dave Matthews fan - I've seen DMB 40+ times in concert and was excited to pick up the Live at Radio City Music Hall cd's.  After a couple of listens, I gotta admit that it's definitely pretty average in my opinion.  I keep waiting for a track to take off but even on my favorites (like #41) they just seem to languish.","1206":"Sounds OK, but nothing really new.  It's great for the hard core fans...","1207":"This is a great quality DVD and the music is great, but Dave acts like he's twacked out in some parts and talks way too much. If you're looking for a DVD to pop in and rock out to, this is not it. If you're looking for something to relax to, this is a good choice.","1208":"Nice Blue ray, but wish it was on one disc and got rid of some of the so so songs. I also agree with the one reviewer that said he only watched this once in a year. I may watch it again but not anytime soon.","1209":"Dave Matthews is great during a live performance.  You cannot go wrong.  Tim Reynolds however sounds like a little kid hitting the high keys on a piano, while you are trying to play a serious piece.  Maybe it worked during the performance, but it does not work on the CD.  This probably explains why this CD is cheaper than other live Dave Matthews Band CD's.  However, for the price, it is a good buy, just skip the pieces you don't like.","1210":"What's with all his Live recordings with Tim sound the same?  They do that annoying guitar vibrato? Good songs, good singing.  Enjoyable cd, just feels like more of the same with Dave. Tim plays well but people that think he is a guitar G-D need to seriously take a step back and listen to some of the 80's and 70's guitar legends.  Those guys had as much if not more talent than Tim.  Tim is a GREAT guitarist, but not the end all be all of rock artists.","1211":"Early & I mean Early Jack nicholson !!! - Not a bad movie for It's Time But You can Find it The budget racks of Dollar Stores & Big Lt's For a Pitance !!!! I'm not Sure it may even be Public Domain ? in which case you can Download it For Free Legally ! I'd not pay much more than @ bucks for The Terror Personally FWIW ?","1212":"Had hoped to get a copy of this somewhat classic movie, but it was sent in dvd zone 1 format and zone 2 was not available. However I was not charged for the item.","1213":"If this season would consists of two collections (like the first two), there would have been 5 stars on top of this review.  Still, it's better than nothing, though I had this nagging feeling the season didn't reach it's full potential. A few more episodes might have done the trick. :)","1214":"It takes a special kind of girl to know exactly what she wants... and not give up anything to get it.","1215":"Well this third and last by the moment Beverly Hills Cop movie is not like the 2 firsts with great action and chases and thrills instead we have some gags and the John Landis style with great directors cameos(George Lucas) and his trademark humour and hits.<p>In the Dvd extras content I must say that this is the most flop of the 3 that's why I give only 3 stars of 5. Paramount Studios should give some extras more to have the level that had the 2 others.","1216":"For a beginner, there are some poses on here that I definitely could not hold.  I thought it was a good workout and taught me about different poses for strengthening, but it seemed more advanced for beginners in some parts with the balancing.  I wasn't expecting easy, just maybe a slower paced beginning.","1217":"I notice the reviews are really mixed on this tape, but I say it's just OK. I have lots of yoga tapes, and this is the one I reach for the least. I think the instructor's delivery is rather unenthusiastic, although I find it soothing in the relaxation portion, and I feel like I need to hold the poses longer to really benefit from them. It does work the lower body, and it's short enough to do before you go to work, but I just can't get excited about it.","1218":"I haven't finished viewing all the dvd's for this series. I have been unable to view so far 2 of the programs out of 3 dvd's because they are garbled. Other than that, it arrived quickly. I still have another dvd to go before I'll know whether any other shows will be unwatchable.","1219":"Even though I like the actors, and the plots were what one would expect, the dialog and editing left me wondering why I liked the program when it aired on TV.","1220":"Ive ordered products from this seller before and theyve been amazing, but halfway into this movie the first time we watched it, it skips and completely freezes, so we have to skip ahead an entire scene. It does that every time we watch it.","1221":"home aloneis porably one of the ulimtmate familymovies.I frist saw it when i was 12. i then proccedto see two moretimesin the theatres. then i got the  video. now iam 22 and stil llike it.culkin gives a good perfomance proboly  because he flimed it before he hit it big.i thiunk he did not want tobe a  big star and thats why some of his later perfomance were not as good anyway  this is cute and good movie.","1222":"Product was great and in good condition. The price was a bit high though for a used DVD.","1223":"Helen Slater (a dead ringer for the woman of steel) appears as \"Supergirl\", a survivor of Argo City in pursuit of the Omegahedron...a device that can turn any thought into reality. A likable adventure. Co-starring Faye Dunaway...who overacts as a wannabe witch. (By the way, When DOESN'T Ms. Dunaway overact?) Also Brenda Vaccaro as her sidekick....who stinks up the screen. Go back to TV commericials, Brenda!","1224":"This movie is a good old fashioned disney movie, clear cut good guy fighting the bad guy. Though the best film to relate this film to would be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0000633U5\">White Fang<\/a>. Pretty much the same story, including the heart felt, get out of my life speech to the cheetah. Yet, still a good enough movie to want to own.","1225":"I grew up watching this movie and was so excited to see it on here.  Having said that, I realized while watching it that I loved it so much because I was a child and it's a good, clean adventure story.  As an actual movie it's not all that great but if you have kids they will probably love it :)","1226":"We had bought a similar movie, Duma, which my family absolutely loved and thought this might be similar.  Watching Cheetah was a total 80s flashback--I had no idea this movie was out in the 80s but now that makes total sense given the wardrobe, the tube socks, the hair, etc.  I had assumed that it had been shelved way back when and was brought out because of the success of Duma.  The movie is enjoyable for a once-through.  Duma is MUCH better.","1227":"first off i do not care for micheal caine second he is no action star the movie seemed long and boring at most parts my favorite part in the whole movie was the end i know by writng this i am making alot of people mad cult classic no","1228":"I love play with me sesame but the cases these come in are crap! The discs came loose. I wish they were packaged different but it is still a good show","1229":"Too bad Sesame Street seems to have taken down all their online game content (August 2008) So much for their educational mission! I guess some of it is available on these DVD\/CD-ROM releases, but it sucks that low income families have to buy them instead of getting the content online, as they've been able to for the last few years. (T-Mom)","1230":"Not much to add as many of the other reviewers describe this piece of goofy frivolity perfectly.  The \"high point\" is the football game at the end.  Playboy Playmates, breasts, and goofy hijinks.  There really isn't much reason to watch this other than the fact there are a lot of topless women in this movie.  'Nuf said.","1231":"this vhs was blurry. needs more gator action & with enough length. i was kind of a long and white lookin gator. if u can find it, widescreen would be better.","1232":"This film, made a long time ago, is an old chestnut, but still there are some good bits in it.  If one likes pomp and ceremony, you will like this.","1233":"I saw this movie as a kid and later when it was released on VHS picked up a copy of it. The movie is visually impressive and its style is more like what you would see years later in music videos. Robert Blake is excellent in this quirky yet dark story about a pint sized motorcycle cop whose ambition sees him investigating a murder case. Hippies, pigs, nymphos and detectives with erectile dysfunction are abound.  I liked the movie and just remember it as being something different and not what you normally expected at the time.","1234":"The good news about this DVD release of Jack the Giant Killer is that it isn't the musical version! The movie was shoot with a release to television in mind.Producer Small intended to light the scenes way to bright and was composing for a little frame.Therefore someone can forgive its full frame presentation and the transfer from a good videomaster. This movie is a rare find and still fun to watch if you love classy stop motion. (...)","1235":"The DVD is free of blemishes and is quite colorful; however, some images are pale, no doubt due to the aging of the original materials. This is especially apparent in composite shots where the models look bright but the backgrounds don't. Probably the best this film is going to look.","1236":"Lower your Harryhausen-like expectations and you'll be pleased with this fantasy adventure.  Nowhere near the Sinbad series but the transfer looks good for a disc of this price....","1237":"I remember seeing Jack the Giant Killer when I was young on a saturday afternoon movies channel. Its a little corney, but for its time, it was a well done flick, Brings back old and good memories!","1238":"This poor-man's \"Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\" is not without it's charm, but the bizarre musical version is the one to find! Sure it's a mess, but WHAT a mess! If you're a fan of strange live-action children's musicals like the K. Gordon Murray Mexican releases (\"Santa Clause\", \"Little Red Riding Hood Meets The Monsters\", etc.) then you'll want to track down the musical version for this movie. Luckily I have my copy that I had taped from cable tv in the early 1980s.","1239":"Tim Allen gives a good spazaz to Joe in this movie that makes it funny. Jim Belushi is great as the person who trains Joe in the ways of self defense. cute and not so crude like most comedys which crudeness ans sickness makes it downfall, but y'all enjoy Allen. for fans of the tool man and Belushi","1240":"Shock Labyrinth was an okay Japanese movie. I wouldn't call this a horror movie, it's more like a suspense movie. So if you're expecting something like The Ring or The Grudge, you're going to be disappointed.","1241":"movie was ok,3D was ok,though it was little better in 2D.couldn't get into movie as much.it was an intresting product.","1242":"I personally like classic movies; this one I never seen before and I enjoyed it.  I recommend it to anyone, you can set back with the family because it doesn't have all the violent crimes (bloody)we normally see now a days.","1243":"I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi movies over the years.  This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.  All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi movie than \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"Evita\".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.","1244":"The film lacks profanity but it's characters do somehow come off three-dimensional all the same for a special reason I won't mention here. Check the film out and see why for yourself. Hint: it's in the last quarter of the film. I see the obvious German-expressionist influences in the film (fitting the film is all about Germans)especially early in the film with the teacher and his students.","1245":"The video downloaded efficiently enough, but the sound quality was poor, probably due to the age of the movie. As a teacher, I purchased the movie to show to my students, since Blockbuster did not have it. It's an excellent movie, but when you teach in a hut and your air conditioner is loud, it was hard for students to hear at times.","1246":"This movie was good.  It is basically how the virus originated and was pretty interesting and would recommend if you are into zombie flixs but keep in mind this movie is primarily dialogue with very minimal action sequences.","1247":"If you like the show and want to know a little more back story, this is a good watch. Be warned, however, it's very obviously one of those hastily assembled behind-the-scenes deals with low production values of its own.","1248":"Mary Poppins is a wonderful tale which combines the very talented Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. It is a great story for both young and old. However this DVD is not what I expected although there were a few extras such as a game and a very brief making of documentary, it was not as indepth as some of the other Disney DVD's on the market. So its thumbs up for the film and a thumbs down for the DVD as a whole.","1249":"I don't feel qualified to review because it is laying where I placed it after I received it.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001JRB16U\">Mary Poppins (Two-Disc 45th Anniversary Special Edition)<\/a>  Looks great from outside of the package and it came as Amazon promised.","1250":"Anyone who has a 16x9, widescreen television will be disappointed to discover that the technical information provided by Disney.  They released this disc saying that it was in a widscreen ANAMORPHIC format.  It is not.  It is widscreen (letterbox) but it is not anamorphic so it is distorted when displayed on a widscreen television.  It's disappointing because this film is one of Walt Disney's crowning achievements and it's too bad that they didn't put it out in the best possible format.","1251":"I love the Inspector Lynley Series but couldn't watch this series because of moving, annoying lines on the top of the screen on all four installments.  I've obtained this series from two different sources now and both have these lines.","1252":"I just bought James Bond Collection, Vol. 2 for my brother and much to my surprise found that THREE of the titles were also in Vol. 1 of the series (which he has).  What a rip-off!  Paid over $100.00 for 3 new discs. Very disappointing.","1253":"The unltimate Classic's of 007's Sean Connery and Roger Moore: Dr. No, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Man With The Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me &amp; Moonraker.<p>Into classics, this is your choice... <p>Into 007 library regardless of how old or new the movies are this is a must.<p>Into 007 new ones, go for The James Bond Collection (1999).","1254":"It is a good souvenir from my Youth. It is in black and white and the sound is not perfect but it always remember me the time when I was only 8 years old. If you do not know the classic series of Robin Hood, buy at least the DVD #1 to learn of Robin of Loxley is become Robin Hood.","1255":"for YEARS this was all we had of Jimi's appearance at the Isle of Wight. It's a shorter, lo-fi version of Wild Blue Angel.<p>Unless you lived with this version, and don't care otherwise, buy the newly released Blue Wild Angel DVD instead, it has MUCH better sound, and the complete performance. Well, almost complete. The CD has two or three tracks, like \"Hey Baby\/New Rising Sun\" that you won't find here.","1256":"you'll refer to this one now again, not often, but you'll be pleased you have it in the collection. <p>the man is clearly from another planet.","1257":"When I boutht this dvd, I thought I was gonna see a whole concert. Was I  totally wrong! This is not an entire concert. But who would forget Jimi's searing rendition of red house? not me. For those of you that like Hendrix's pyrotechnics, get the following: Woodstock, Berkeley, Monterey, and Experience. I can't wait to get Wild Blue Angel when it comes out on Digipack and Dvd. Sources tell me that Jimi picked with his teeth on &quot;hey Joe&quot;. The digipack wi tell me the truth Also on &quot;foxy lady&quot;,  Jimi picks with his teeth as well.","1258":"Before I saw this movie, I thought it was a comedy. But this movie is so gory and there is so much violence that you shouldn't call it a real comedy. It is a thriller with some funny moments. <p>If you look at it  serious, you will probably hate it. But if you don't think about the  tragedy and the drama, then it's an enjoyable movie. <p>The performances of  the actors are great and there are some very funny scenes. <p>Good to see  once, but not twice.","1259":"This was a good movie.  Not great, but well worth watching... when your mom is not around.  The cast is perfect and the comedy ensues as the errors compound, erupting in a final &quot;happy&quot; ending.  See this movie at least once.","1260":"This film is just plain bad, but then it's fun, if you have a slow Saturday afternoon.  This DVD is made from a very poor print and looks soft to me.  You'll see some actors that you've seen in other films from this era, but all-in-all just watch it for fun.","1261":"Fans of fifties creature features should enjoy this smarmy swamp saga about vampirish predators that keep captives in caves to suffer lingering, sucked-dry deaths.  The monsters are fearsomely fun, the hero hairy-chested and handsome, the leading lady clingy and lovely, and the leading non-lady cleavaged and vampily luscious.  The scripting is tolerably sensible, and the acting and direction are above average for this sort of cinema.  In its day, this movie's gruesome mutants and waterborne dead bodies would have seemed more grisly than gleeful.  But today,  both adjectives can be applied in abundance!","1262":"Not  much to say about the movie, it's a Saturday afternoon 'B' movie, with Ken Clark looking very hunky and a bit wooden!","1263":"Good story of innocence, corruption, and capitalist economies. Satirical black comedy w\/an unexpected frayer in the end.","1264":"The Israelis portrayed in the film are all crass, greedy, selfish, dishonest, exploitative, overweight slobs. What could have been an honest critique of materialistic capitalism and contemporary Israel degenerates into an apology for the Intifada, tinged with the stench of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. I guess the hate group that bankrolled this film got what they wanted.","1265":"Claimed to be in both full and wide screen. But, not so. Either side is full screen!","1266":"Going into this movie I figured it would be a Bush bashing film. I was wrong. It was actually very balanced and an interesting look into the former president's life. His hard drinking days up until when he quit drinking (age 40), was an eye opener and almost disturbing at times. Another head shaker was his father (George Sr.) bailing \"Junior\" out of one mess after another and the film depicting George W. as a perpetual party animal, time waster and unable to stay gainfully employed until he stopped his boozing. It is a worthwhile watch. BnB Beatles Depot","1267":"Could have chosen someone who favored W. Bush a lot better. Should have stuck to more historic facts. Almost tried to be a comedy, when I expected a true to life fact filled movie.","1268":"Some say this film is sympathetic towards my Hero, but I don't think it is. What i'm really mad at is that Stone FAILED to include the capture of Saddam Hussein!! Come on!! Remember when Saddam was capture and the Stock Markets Bolted to the HIGHEST they've ever been. the Economy was so healthy when Saddam was captured.  Oh yeah, Stone also failed to mention Bushes support of Israel. Another benefit of Liberating Iraq...the safety of Israel.","1269":"If you are looking for factual details behind historical events...or even an educated guess on what goes on behind the political curtains...you will be greatly disappointed in this film; however, if you are looking to be entertained by a toned-down version of the media's portrait of this President's personality (yes, it's superficial)...you may find it amusing.  Bottom line...buy this for the mild entertainment factor, don't expect a history lesson.","1270":"Some of this movie is interesting but it is definately not something that will keep you awake.  If you're tired I would suggest not watching this movie.  The way George Bush made his way to the presidency was interesting but the remaining parts of the movie could have been left out.  I should have read a review before purchasing the movie.","1271":"Were you present when Jim Morrison died?  Neither was I, nor Oliver Stone so we are left to speculate.  You can research all you want about W, but in the end, who can say for sure.  Perhaps not even the Uniter himself.  With no disrespect, I think he is best forgotten--not the subject of a major movie.","1272":"Here's a movie from Oliver Stone that turns out to be very restrained, somewhat drawn out, and ultimately not that compelling.  There was so much more that could have been done here, but too much time was spent on W's daddy issues and his ballpark fantasies.  Also, there should have been some mention of W's bungling of the Katrina hurricane disaster. That said, Josh Brolin got the inflections down just right, while Richard Dreyfuss virtually stole the show as Dick Cheney.  The flashbacks were not confusing, and the choices of songs were perfect. A mixed bag.","1273":"All movie attempts to present Bush Jr. as a cheap shadow of his daddy, Bush Sr., look mostly like the funny bubbling of own kid nasty sometimes but always \"own bastard\".  Oliver Stone's speculations of Iraq and Afghanistan wars would much more convincingly sound if for start the predominant majority of American voters reject, once and forever, a non-stoppable usage of their personal cars in big cities to ease dependence on energy sources well feeding terrorists back on the American soil de-facto absorbing increasingly for \"humanitarian reasons\" new waves of terror breeding seed.","1274":"The highlight of this so-so interpretation of Zorro (well-portrayed by Douglas Fairbanks in the 1920 silent film classic, Guy Williams in Disney's successful 1957-1959 television series and, in my opinion, given the definitive portrayal by Duncan Regehr in the New World television series that aired from 1990-1993), is the-SPOILER WARNING!!!-swordfight between the villainous Captain & Don Diego aka Zorro. Why bother seeing this film in color when it was filmed in black-and-white? I think this  a so-so version of the character because-SPOILERS!!!-he threatens Inez and he kills the villain.","1275":"It has been said of Sinatra, not a nice person off screen but on screen, always dependable and in charge of the situation. He even outshadowed the venerable Trevor Howard in this one. As a drama, very good and as a war movie, good again. Interesting locations like the old ruins. Back to Sinatra, seen many movies with him and never a bad one.","1276":"This was an okay movie.  It had it's funny parts.<p>This movie is about 3 girls who are in a band The Pussycats.  When they are walking a across the street a guy sees them and thinks he can make them into the next big thing.","1277":"I was so happy when I heard about this movie. I bought the soundtrack right away b\/c Kay Hanley Of Letters To Cleo did the singing and I am a big fan of hers, but the movie in general could have been better. I thought it was a very fun movie to rent and I enjoyed it. I thought the movie was going to be mainly about the band, but it turned mostly to be about the record company and that disappointed me. I also think they could have given more credit to Kay Hanley for her amazing vocals!","1278":"ALot of the footage that is discernable is not from Master Soken but from some other guy.  There is some footage of the Hakutusuru(or so the narrator Claims) but it was very short.  The peices of the weaponry\/kata performed by Master Soken are excellent.  I reccomend it only if you have the extra $$ to throw around , it isn't all that great but is ok for the enthusiast  PS(The narrator becomes quite irratating)","1279":"Did anyone else notice this is being advertised and sold as Cheers: The Tenth Season rather than Cheers: The Complete Tenth Season? Season 9 says The Complete Ninth season and yet we all know that's not true as scenes were edited and music changed. It even said so itself on the back of the box. So this time they list it as only The Tenth season which makes we wonder how much they butchered this season.","1280":"the three-star rating is for the box set... it's gone cheap with just a box sleeve (season 9 is the turning point). not only is this bad for collection purpose, but the entire set is inconsistent.","1281":"If you just view the scenes that Metatron, &quot;Herald of the Almighty and the Voice of God&quot;, is in, the story is less murky. Dogma is irreverent (hooray!) and creative, but it would have benefitted from a more ruthless editor. Some of the scenes seem to be pointless digressions to provide a space for some low 7th grade humor. But if you concentrate on scenes with the testy seraphim, Metatron (superbly played by Alan Rickman), the film holds together really well and has a heart.","1282":"Downsides: Kind of noticeably low budget, and affleck &amp; damon are particularly bad in this movie.<p>Upsides: (1) The plot, as it's presented, isn't totally horrible (yes, that sounds slightly bad, because it kind of is in an absolute sense, but relative to affleck &amp; damon's acting it's actually an upside for this movie), and (2) bethany, jay, silent bob, &amp; the 13th apostle actually are pretty darn good.","1283":"I love Mr. Smith's directing and writing. He's just freakin' awesome. So I hold him to very high standards. I know a lot of people talked trash about this movie, but it really wasn't bad. What it was, was corrupted by Kevin Smith's celebrity friends and their cameos. One of the things about Kevin Smith's earlier movies was the actors involved didn't detract from the movie. Even Amy with a then-unknown Ben Affleck. In this case, however, it's hard to let the story shine with people like Matt Damon involved. And don't get me wrong- I love Matt Damon.","1284":"The DVD is packed with excellent features.  The film isn't.  The Catholic church is a very easy target for ridicule and this film always makes the easy jokes.  At its best Dogma can be really quite funny but at its worst it is simply amateurish, unfortunately there is very little of the best.","1285":"First, let me say this: JAY is not funny!! Silent Bob: funny. Jay: not so funny. Jay is a loud, raucious kid who is not funny. That said, the movie is pretty good. Never seen a Kevin Smith film before (don't think I ever will either). I'm not Catholic like the movie (not ever movie can be perfect), but I enjoyed MOST of it nonetheless.<p>Did anyone else notice Jay and Silent Bob in SCREAM 3? Just thought I'd throw that in while I wait for the &quot;How can you not like Kevin Smith movies&quot; hate mail.","1286":"Watching Dogma is like hanging out with college kids eating pizza, smoking pot, and talking about religion; that is to say, it may be entertaining, but it's not particularly profound, intelligent, or well thought-out.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon work well together, and it's pleasant to watch their chemistry.  If that's enough to make you want to watch Dogma, by all means: go, see, be entertained.  Just don't expect a whole lot more.","1287":"The premise was pretty good, but that's as far as it went","1288":"i really liked this movie, it was funny and had action. but no drama, well some drama. this did get good ratings in the theaters and i understand those ratings but i think my ratings make more sense. bye","1289":"I'LL BE GLAD WHEN SAW 4 AND 5 IS A CHEAP ER DEAL AND SAW 3.","1290":"This movie was creepy, shocking, and finally, gross.  It was ok..However, although there are other SAWs out there, for me, one was enough.","1291":"We heard about this movie and ordered it to watch on Halloween. Our plans was to pop some popcorn and watch Saw. Forget about eating while watching this show. If you like bloody shows with body parts cut off you will love this movie. Myself I don't care for it.","1292":"Not a review but a question. Does this work on UK Playstations as only SAW III is available on Region B for some reason?","1293":"i thought that it was going to be more bloody than the SAW movie was. It was or at least I didn't think it was. The only cool thing was the case that the movie came in. the front is like a bag of some sort with blood in it and a jigsaw that floats around. really cool. not sure if it's worth the exact money for this version of the dvd.","1294":"I really liked the premise of this movie and understand why it spawned a sequel, but what about that terrible acting!?!  Everyone in the movie seemed to be 'phoning in' their performance.  This movie was fairly original and disturbing, but just think how good it could have been.","1295":"It was a geneously nerve pinching movie, acting was tiring at times but Leigh Whannell's performance in the last two minutes of the film was orgasmic, you can't beat seeing that kind of true-intense fear on a cute guys face. I would recommend it to a select audience but enforce the fact that it's a good nighttime movie. You aren't afraid of the dark are you?","1296":"Can't believe I'm the first person to review this film... I really don't know what to think.  It's one of those movies that when it is over you think \"now why didn't I pay more attention the first time.\"  Without giving the ending away I did wonder about this one character..... Don't think I'd ever watch it again.  Frankly I prefer Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers to this one.  Very gory and hard to follow the story line.  Probably this movie is for viewers under the age of 30 that are used to modern day gore.  Sorry!","1297":"The movie did have a few good scenes, yet I found the ending unsatisfying and even disappointing and also, there are some obvious inconsistencies in the story line.","1298":"I originally bought the whole series for our son because he said Saw was a great movie.  I dont like \"bloody\" movies but this does have plot.  More like a \"moral of the story\" plot.  Teresa Kernersville NC","1299":"Overall Saw was a decent movie I just wish that the lead role would have been given to someone else, Carl just couldn't get that emotion across for some reason and it took something away from the movie.  The story and irony of of this film were great, it also had some pretty good gore along with some genuinly scary scenes,but,  HOLLYWOOD-KEEP CARL EWLES OUT OF HORROR\/THRILLER FILMS!!!!!!","1300":"if gorey is what your looking for then this is it.  if plot is what your looking for then it seems like this movie is a lot like the plot of another by the name of \"SEVEN\"  its not like a clone of SEVEN but in ways its the same.  i also hated the ending if you have one bullet you shoot the pad lock... duh","1301":"Saw is a great movie, all the sequels can be skipped. However the video quality on the Blu-ray is pretty disappointing. Very grainy, never once really looked like a high-def video even in bright scenes. But what makes it even worse is that there are no extras whatsoever. No commentary, no deleted scenes, nothing besides some previews. Sad,sad,sad. At least it was cheap.","1302":"I enjoyed the movie and if you did too, I would recommend reading books by Richard Laymon. In specific a book called In the Dark, but really any of his other books have the same kind of perverse twistedness of Saw.","1303":"As I'm going to have nightmares for the rest of my life.  Definitely the most traumatizing and sickest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  Whomever the writer is, however, is a genius because he definitely gave us a lesson in a sick and twisted way.","1304":"This movie was not that good.  It was ok...the premise was interesting, but the ending and the development left me wanting.  I for one didn't think Cary Elwes was that bad...I don't really look for horror movies to really have good \"acting.\"  Danny Glover must have hit rock bottom or something by taking part in this project.  Anyway, I would wait until this movie is at Hollywood Video or something.","1305":"I prefer scary movies that are heavy on the suspense, light on the bloodshed, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars. This movie was very, very bloody. There were a couple of twists, to be sure, but I would say that the extreme grisliness outweighed the suspense.  \"Saw\" made me think of a very long music video, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I did think that it borrowed a lot from \"Seven\", which starred Brad Pitt.","1306":"Wow, I am surprised I could sleep well the night after I saw Saw... lol... I love the gore and the puzzle ideas. I sometimes sit alone and think of other puzzles that would be interesting to think about. I think that the ending was well thought out and wonderful. Twisted Pictures is so da bomb.","1307":"Perhaps, Saw isn't a movie that I will add to my movie library any time soon.  Be that as it may, it no doubt asserts itself as a rather memorable movie nonetheless.  From the beginning, you are thrust into a sick milieu that will, if anything, grab your attention and not let go until the clever ending.  While not great by any stretch, Saw is most definitely worth a look for those who enjoy Seven and the like.","1308":"great suprise ending, but lacks scares and is sort of boring like in my opinion","1309":"When i got saw, i thought \"Finally, a gore fest in a movie!\",  but there isn't a lot of blood in it. That was a dissapoinment.  The story is completley dumb. I thought that the puppet was the killer. But it's some retarted fat bald guy. If you want a gore fest, this will dissapoint. First when you see it, you will want to close your eyes beacuse you dont want to see brutal, gory murders, dont, nothing will happen, it will censor it by going to another scene. Thats just stupid. Rent it.","1310":"\"Saw\" is by far the best of the 3 \"Saw\" movies. It has suspense, was very unpredictable, and had creative murder sequences. They should have stopped with this one though because Saw II and Saw III are horrible.","1311":"\"Saw\" is movie about a serial \"killer\", who doesnt actually kill his victims himself, he finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Which is actually a pretty interesting idea, and this movie had tons of potential. But its bogged down by marginal acting and holes in the plot. I really cant elaborate on the holes in the plot because it would give away the ending, but in the end you really dont get any resolution or closure. This is a decent movie to just sit around and watch with your friends, but dont expect anything oscar worthy.","1312":"\"Saw\" wants to be \"Se7en\" with more blood and gore.  It doesn't succeed on any level, but is a decent horror\/thriller.  The plot is intriguing and disturbing, as two men are locked in a dirty, closed room where the only escape is by killing the other.  The Jigsaw Killer is never as scary as he should be and the quickly explained twist is a little disappointing, but looking past plot holes and the rip-offs, \"Saw\" delivers some good scenes of scares and holds up as a decent horror flick, despite Cary Elwe's god-awful acting.","1313":"I'm just curious as to why people keep referring to this movie as &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;..it really wasn't.It wasn't graphic or gory or anything..I watched this movie last nite with the expectations that it was going to be incredibly weird and freaky and thought provoking..well it really wasn't-it pretty much just had a basic murder mystery plot..I'm not saying it was a bad movie,it wasn't really and I liked the way music played a big role in the film,I just honestly don't understand what the big deal surrounding this movie is.","1314":"This is a great movie, but with the new 5.1 surround mix on the new edition coming out soon, it would be a waste to get it.","1315":"This movie wasn't near as disturbing as I had hoped.  I was actually bored during quite a few scenes.  It would have been better if I hadn't expected so much, from reading all sorts of reviews.  I'm actually watching the end of it right now while I'm writing this review, that's how interested I am. lol  Oh, well.","1316":"The Bottom Line:  A bizarre fever-dream of a movie, Blue Velvet succeeds in its attempts to shock and provides several memorable scenes, but the glossy exterior hides its lack of interesting characters and a soul.","1317":"I watched this movie twice in the same day. I found it to be very funny, sad and disturbing. The cast is great. The soundtrack is fantastic. I found myself really liking this group of hapless, dirty, warped, lowlife criminal drug addicts as they dreamed and plotted. I found myself laughing, smiling, on the verge of tears, upset, confused and disappointed along with these guys. I WANTED them to succeed at being criminals. It's certainly worth a look. If you don't buy it, do yourself a favor and rent it for the acting and soundtrack alone.","1318":"I saw it many years ago when it came out in theatres. Good movie, that's why I ordered it this day and age.  The quality was not very good.  The colors were off, the soundtrack was a bit off, and there was a skip in the movie.  I didn't pay much for it and still consider it a good deal.  I happen to like old movies and actors of yester year.","1319":"I was nine years old in 1974 when this picture came to film in Oroville, California. I'm a native of Oroville.  Although the quality of the performance of the main characters leaves much to be desired,It leaves a good feeling when I view the picture now to see some scenes in Oroville (and some surrounding areas) that have REALLY changed over the past thirty three years. Many of the extras I know along with the memory of one Saturday when a scene was filming downtown were the Butte County Courthouse was once located.","1320":"Originally shot in 3D! Why is there no 3D Blu-ray release? Certainly this film stands tall (like the star himself) when compared to many of the 3D Blu-ray releases available today. It is such a lost opportunity and a real shame that yet another new generation will be denied this 3D classic as it was meant to be seen.","1321":"If you are buying this video for your little Elmo fan, think again. Elmo hardly appears at all; it's mostly popular groups singing songs with a few muppets thrown in. I think it's a good video, but it's not really at my  12-month-old son's level. He wants non-stop Elmo action, not people  singing. This might be better for the 4-6 year old crowd.","1322":"We got this DVD for our 18-month old and he just isn't that interested in it. Not much to engage a young toddler, especially since Elmo doesn't make many appearances nor does my son's favorite, Cookie Monster. My son much prefers the Elmo DVD about babies and animals. Or he also likes Elmo Loves You. This DVD though is fun for adults who are Jon Stewart and Chris Rock fans.","1323":"While my husband and I find this video entertaining, it's too grown-up for my 15-month-old.  The beauty of Sesame Street generally is that it intersperses adult humor (via adult references) with children's entertainment.  This video seems to contain more of the former than the latter.  There is too much human dialogue and not enough song and dance to keep my daughter's interest for long.  Maybe she'll appreciate it more in a few years, but for now, it's more appropriate for mommy and daddy.","1324":"It is a little slow at moments and it doesn't always keep my little boy's attention.","1325":"Beware!  There is an existing DVD copy of &quot;Diva&quot; out there which was released in the late 1990s.  Although the film is great fun, the DVD fails at the most critical part: the sound quality is miserable.  If this DVD is a newly-minted release of &quot;Diva&quot;, then never mind my complaints, enjoy this excellent film.  If it is just a re-release of the original DVD, then save your time and money.","1326":"Beware!  There is an existing DVD copy of &quot;Diva&quot; out there which was released in the late 1990s.

If it is just a re-release of the original DVD, then save your time and money.","1327":"This is a great movie, but the quality is horrible. Some scenes the video gets to so bad, its hard to see their faces. I would recommend getting the John Wayne collection one.","1328":"I have enjoyed this movie for years, as well as other John Wayne movies.  I originally saw this on VHS and was thrilled to finally have the movie on DVD.  But I was really disappointed.  The recording was terrible.  The picture was sometimes crystal clear, and then would be blurred and lined.  My VHS recording was better and also had extended scenes that I missed in the DVD version.  My recommendation would be to wait until a better version comes along.","1329":"This is one of my favorite JW movies - but the quality of this DVD was disappointing.  Dialog was cut from the movie in several places and there are streaks in many of the frames throughout the film.  Buy the movie, it is enjoyable to watch, but get the authorized version.","1330":"Delta\/LaserLight has also put out McLintock on DVD and it appears to use the same source GoodTimes used for their VHS and DVD, in other words, do not buy this DVD either.  Too bad as this is a great movie.  I will keep it until the John Wayne estate puts out an authorized DVD of it though.  I have averaged it to 3 stars because of the great movie but lousy DVD.","1331":"This is one of my favorite movies, hey, it's a John Wayne flick.  Lots of fun, action, and the standard brawl scene.  Unfortunately, the video quality is the worst I've seen on a DVD... muddy color, blurry, grainy.  I'm not sure if the film was shot widescreen or not, but this DVD is not widescreen.  If a new edition came out with the problems corrected, I'd rebuy it.  The lack of technical quality gets in the way of the enjoyment of the movie.  Were it not for the video quality problems, I'd give it 5 stars.","1332":"I do so wish that Turner, or whoever owns the rights to this movie would release it on DVD from a better print of the film. I love this movie, it makes me howl with laughter. This laughter is mitigated by the horrible copy the DVD was pressed from. Sheesh. There is a much better copy available, I have seen it on VHS.","1333":"Lots of violence, lots of gore, lots of shooting, and cathartic if you are really into it. I liked this movie for the variety of weapons and the ambushes the protagonist employs. Other reviewers would have you believe that virtually all big-city dwellers were victims of violent crime in the 1970s. Crime was higher in that decade, but so were certain demographic markers that had nothing to do with politics or policy. This film's major impact was to render most white suburbanites terrified to enter large cities, so it was good for suburban sprawl and Republicans.","1334":"... or were certain scenes edited from this DVD version just like Paramount did with \"Thief Of Hearts\"? I could have sworn the rape scene was originally longer and more graphic.","1335":"That's for sure. This film has a lot of storyline, more so than Death Wish 2. I like Hope Lange so its a pity her role`as Kersey's wife couldn't have been larger. I really don't feel this film is 100% true to life in 1970's New York City. It is exagerrated in it's depiction of how much crime NYC used to have. But hey it's only a movie.","1336":"This was a gift for my brother in Germany and I made sure that the dvd had no region limitations. However, once out of the box and in the dvd player in Germany it did not play. It does play in the States.  The delivery time and quality of the dvd was excellent, albeit not in the intendet region.","1337":"The movie is very nice and it's good to review it and remember the good times. But, as a Brazilian, and considering that the blu-ray region refers from North America to South America, I thought the subtitles would be in Portuguese fom Brazil, not from Portugal. There is a significant difference between both.","1338":"This one starts out with the music \"Blue Moon.\" Two ordinary young men are backpacking in England when they are attacked by a werewolf. One is killed and the other is in a London hospital for weeks. In the hospital an attraction develops between the surviving young man, David, and Nurse Price, a very beautiful captivating young woman. David moves in with the nurse. They fall madly in love. However, David was attacked by a werewolf and he is facing a transformation experience at the next full moon .......","1339":"An American Werewolf in London disappointed me.  There was too much humor, too many living-dead people, and the werewolf was too small.  The turning scene was pretty good, but not as good as THE HOWLING.","1340":"I bought the copy of American Werewolf in London on blue-ray. When I received the disk I opened it and put it in my blue-ray player to watch it. About 3\/4 through the movie it skipped a bunch of scenes. Totaling about 35-40 mins of the movie. I took the disk out and there was nothing wrong with it as far as I could see. So I'm a little disappointed that I got a faulty disk. Wish I could get a new copy or my money back.","1341":"The print was fuzzy. No pun intended. It needs to be restored. Why have a hi-def print with so many artifacts in the print of the film??????","1342":"I have to agree that the picture quality is less than stellar. Very grainy throughout, even the indoor scenes. Probably one of the worst looking blu-rays I have seen. Still love the movie though and David Naughton is hot! Especially without his clothes on! What a body!","1343":"I love watching the Backyardigans, so I purchased this DVD.  In each of the four episodes, the color of the characters is distorted, making it hard to watch.  Uniqua and Austin appear dark red.  Tasha appears as light green, and the white areas on Pablo also appear green.  It is very distracting.","1344":"Originally shot in 3D! Why is there no 3D Blu-ray release? Certainly this film stands tall (like the star himself) when compared to many of the 3D Blu-ray releases available today. It is such a lost opportunity and a real shame that yet another new generation will be denied this 3D classic as it was meant to be seen.","1345":"Brings back wonderful memories of a better and simpler time. Very tongue in cheek. Plots are a little thin as series progress. Good viewing for baby boomer generation. EH","1346":"This guy is the Real Thing! Grooving Shagging super crooner Deany the Martini of Ocean's Eleven Rat Pack lays own the ladies and puts the bad guys in their place, all with a twinkle in his scotch glass! Great fun for everyone except recovering alcoholics!","1347":"Although Matt Helm is no James Bond you can't help but smile at Dean's antics. Most critics dislike the series, but if you don't treat the movies seriously, they can be a lot of fun.","1348":"When I was about eight, the Matt Helm movies were new. I watched them all at the drive-in theatre where my mother worked. And I loved them.  Attitudes toward women have changed immensely since then, making them a little more difficult to watch.  On the upside, Helm, as played by Dean Martin, doesn't take himself too seriously. He always _almost_ gets the girl, but rarely, erm, scores. Despite the sexism, the women often outshine, out think and out perform Helm and the other men.  Fun. Very 1960s. Definitely not for everyone.","1349":"A glimpse of group male physical examinations during earlier war time periods.  Most gay guys would be pleased to see what was going on in those days and how embarassing it was!","1350":"I might have made a mistake in reading the book first.  Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish do a fantastic job in this film, but the characters and the sences were not as developed as they were in the book, obvioulsy.  There was so much more that I kept waiting for that never came from the movie.  Things from the book that I thought would be important to the story, that couldn't fit in the 108 minutes.  I definately recommend the book over watching the movie.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0345423879\">Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction<\/a>","1351":"Listen, I'll make it my point to agree with one particular reviewer who made a good point.So, this movie isn't particularly intelligent or &quot;deep&quot;.It's not oscar worthy, and its not gonna offer up any mind blowing performances.It IS however,solid entertainment that'll give you warm fuzzies for the hour and a half it takes up. Just curl up in front of the tv when you have nothing better to do, and watch this film.Sure its lighthearted, but its feel-good, and sometimes thats just what you need.","1352":"Director Mike Figgis followed up his triumphant &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; with this disappointing film.<p>Wesley Snipes takes a rare (understandbly so) turn as a dramatic actor.  Kinski attempts to resurrect her career (and fails).  Only Ming Na Wen escapes unscathed from this vacuous &quot;drama&quot;.  Unfortunately, she is now voicing computer generated characters in &quot;Final Fantasy - Flop&quot;.","1353":"This routine lives up to its title - Pure and Simple.  I found this a bit too basic (and boring) even for a beginner.  She has a better strecth routine in later offerings. I returned this DVD, and now I'm looking for something a little more challenging - something that makes you feel like you've stretched and exercized when done.","1354":"The Bottom Line:  Coupling a garden-variety inspiration teacher story to an uninteresting love triangle between Julia Roberts and her two suitors, Mona Lisa Smile is only of interest to people who want to see the fairly rare occurrence of a movie told from a woman's perspective; other than that, it's hardly worth watching.","1355":"A nice female coming of age story;a little choppy in places, a good \"Chick Flick\" to be enjoyed on a lazy afternoon .","1356":"I enjoyed this film but it wasent a great film to see over and over again. The charactors are likeable and the story is somewhat interesting. The story drags on at times but it has a good story and is insperational at tiems. It's not Julia Roberts best film but it's still enjoyable.","1357":"Mona Lisa Smile starring Julia Roberts tries to be an inspiring film about young women making a difference in society but it fails to deliver that message. Robert's performance isn't so motivating especially since she's playing a college professor, her character doesn't teach the girls any valuable information, she preaches rather than giving them heartfelt advice. The supporting cast falls flat as well especially Kirsten Dunst but Gennifer Goodwin does shine in her role. Don't expect much from Mona Lisa Smile, feminisism is a more powerful tool than this film has to offer.","1358":"My husband and I watched this movie one evening.  This is a difficult and frustrating movie to finish~If in real life you treat everyone in your family with equal amounts of love.  You might want to pre-view this first before watching it for family night.  Although it has good lessons. The way the parents have raised their girls is kind of messed up!  We chose not to show it to our children after previewing it.","1359":"Chris has grown up with the show he must be going through puberty, his voice sounds very different now.  I loved the first 2 seasons but I must say season 3 is little slow pace and not as fun as the first two.  They have developed a several characters in the show (babershop boys, homeless guy, etc) but I personally dont find them funny at all.  I think the dad & mum are great though, brilliant actors!","1360":"It's not a bad movie, I just lost interest half way through. I don't understand how then came up with this name for the movie.","1361":"Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is this lying, backstabbing, mooch sister.  Diaz's sister (Rose) is a successful lawyer.  Apparently this movie shows how Diaz evolves and becomes a better sister, and how Rose stops being so uptight and learns to live life. Personally, if I was Rose, I would never forgive Maggie.  The Maggie character is a burden on Earth.  Most of the movie is able to hold the viewer's attention but some parts are kind of boring.  In Her Shoes is ok to watch once.  I must have had high expectations because this movie did not live up to them.","1362":"while the Movie went into alot of areas from to time&couldn't make up it's mind if it was gonna be serious or funny there was a good story line about the relationship of two sisters,there father&there grandmother. the film kinda flip-flopped on certain issues&things,but the film was alright.Cameron Diaz did alright. Shirley Mclaine was alright though she has been playing the same role since She did\"Terms of Endearment\".this film had some good things going for it.","1363":"I was a bit disappointed after watching In Her Shoes. It was pretty good, but not what I expected. Fairly predictable. Two sisters bonding with each other and their grandma. One gets married, one learns the meaning of life- and it doesn't have to include premarital relations. Not a movie for kids or a young teenager.","1364":"If you read the book you'll want to see it thought it wasn't as good as the book.  Cameron Diaz played her part well.","1365":"This movie is a chick-flick of the highest order, focusing on the difficulties and underlying love between the hot sister Cameron Diaz and the homely sister Toni Collette.  Many over-the-top emotional scenes designed to make women cry.  Certainly redeems itself with many shots of Miss Diaz in skimpy bikinis.  Watch it with your wife or girlfriend.  She'll love it that you volunteered to do a girl movie tour of duty and hopefully you can use that to get lucky.","1366":"Overall the product is exactly the show you'd expect. But the recording on file has 2-3 minute dead spots where the commercials were. This isn't drawn from the disc editions, it's drawn from the TV masters.","1367":"Love the book.  The movie is a bit weak, but sweet.  Worth a watch if you're a fan of the book and Emma Watson.","1368":"This movie version of  the children's classic is well-acted by a lovely cast, but lacks the charm and interest of the original (which remains worth reading).  Still, suitable for family viewing, and, though the ending falls flat, moderately entertaining.  A chick flick for young girls.","1369":"No blood, no smoking tires, no serial killers! And yet no boredom and falling asleep! Invite Your grand daughter and enjoy it! Sweet girls in a lovely story! Everything is fine in this little movie.","1370":"A charming and appealing film with a theatrical feel. I think lots of tweens will relate to the three girls who have dreams that they strive for and have to learn how to achieve them when messy life gets in the way. This movie reminds me of the American Girl stories. I'm impressed with the young actress Yasmin Paige as Petrova; she shows remarkable talent. I found myself bored even though the pacing moved at a remarkable speed. Basically, I was entertained for an hour and twenty minutes but it's a forgettable film.","1371":"Cute This movie was good for a quiet Friday with my little dancer. Thought there would be more dancing in it though.","1372":"I got this movie to watch one weekend and found it fun to see where dancing would take the sisters. But when my mom and sisters wanted to watch it again and agian I found other things to do.  I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it to the movie. As far as the film goes it is entertaining enough to watch once and see what happens, but not great enough to rewatch as a classic.","1373":"This movie was not what I expected, but was still a cute show. The way the family was formed was a curiosity. there wasn't a real strong feeling about the Movie. I should have rented it instead of buying it.","1374":"I just purchased this film and watched it twice for a fair review. I thought the beginning and the ending was rushed; especially the ending. Too much smoking. Loved the characters and thought they were well cast. I bought it for grand daughters and don't know if I'll lend it to them because of the excessive smoking. I guess I anticipated something more like \"The Railroad Children.\"","1375":"Out of the movies we have seen this one is a little different and my daughter really didn't care for it at all.  She has watched it maybe 5 times and everytime she had NO interest what so ever in it.  I feel it was a waste of money.","1376":"I purchased this dvd for my 3 year old son who has been resistant to using the potty. He has been interested in watching the the dvd and has requested it a few times, but he hasn't voluntarily started using the potty without considerable prodding from me.","1377":"This is a pretty good video - gives nice instruction on how to use the potty and seems motivating however it did not work for my son.  He enjoys watching the video along with his other dvd's but it did not cause him to suddenly start using the potty.  I would recommend trying it though if you are having difficulties potty training your toddler - I had a similar video when my daughter was a toddler (now she is a preteen) and it helped to motivate her so what doesn't work for some may work for others.","1378":"Songs are catchy and two year old loves it (so does one year old), but she's not potty trained yet.","1379":"I like this one, but my 2 year old son prefers \"Potty Time\" over \"Potty Power\" so I'm only giving it 3 starts. We do watch both of them, but he only asks to watch \"Potty Time.\" I thought the \"big kid\" test (a series of examples of what babies do versus big kids) would have more of an impact, and maybe for other kids it will.","1380":"The video itself is quite good.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for these 2 disappointments.  Not all kids use a potty chair.  I am a daycare provider and a mom of 2 and we use the toddler seats that sit on top of the regular toilet seat.  The video teaches kids only about potty chairs.  Second disappointment is that I'm training 2 and 3 year olds. The kids in the video are much older (4 to 6 age range).","1381":"Now that my daughter is 2, we are hoping to really ramp up the potty training and get things moving.  She was introduced to it a while ago and knows the concepts, but just doesn't have much motivation.  This DVD is geared more towards older kids, I would say 3 and up - kids who are able to get their pants up and down by themselves and wipe on their own and wash their hands by themselves.  My daughter liked watching the video during the songs, but other than that she did not show much interest.","1382":"This video is narrated by a cute woman and is put together effectively and professionally. I found it to be a slight waste of money and space. Most of our potty training efforts were hands on. I don't think that watching a video helped my boys learn more about potty training. But sometimes every little bit helps.","1383":"This is a good video and has great songs!  I love the fact that it captured my son's attention for more than 15 minutes.  I think it is a great form of entertainment, but I'm not sure if it's the \"answer\" for potty training.  We set up a portable DVD player in the bathroom by his potty chair for him to watch while he sat there.  Nothing happened, but it did help him sit there.","1384":"This product was what I ordered but it didn't play in my DVD player.  (It could be my player but i've not had any problems with any other DVD.  It would play some of the DVD but it would stop at a certain point and not continue)  I was able to play on my computer so we just watch it from there.","1385":"I wish the video went over using the potty more! I have a 2 1\/2 year old boy, and the video really didn't help.","1386":"This DVD is a cute but simple show that explains potty training to little ones. I found it too simple and for my son who is a late bloomer where potty training is concerned. He was not impressed with the simplicity of the songs and stories. I think this DVD is more geared to early potty trainers.","1387":"The majority of reviews for this video were great so I was really excited to have my daughter start potty training (she's almost 2 1\/2). She loved the video, asked to watch it over and over again but about the 5th time I have her sit on the potty she started bawling and asked for her diapers. I think the 'big kid' term makes her think she's not our 'baby' anymore. She may just not be ready to start :( So she liked the video but so far it's not been effective in our house.","1388":"Every child is different, and that's why I bought three DVDs at the same time to help my 2.5 y.o. - Elmo's Potty time, Potty Power and Go Potty Go!.  Potty Power in my opinion had too much of \"young lady talking\", and not enough of \"cute animated animals actually doing it\"  Go Potty Go! was the one that worked. Cute, brain-washing songs, excellent animation.. Go Potty Go!","1389":"I got this video to be seen by my 2 and 3 yr. old.  It is definitely not for a little trainer since it has a section that states about being a big kid where you do not do this or that anymore.  Some of the items hold true for a two yr. old, but several of the items do not.  This video is enjoyed by my three yr. old, but too old for the two yr. old.","1390":"I have had this video for about 3 months now. the quality is really poor...the sounds is not in sync with the video, but for a [...], it really doesn't matter. My son LOVES to watch this video, but it has had NO impact on his interest in potty training. He goes around saying potty power and asking to watch the movie, but the second you mention him using the potty, he refuses. It's cute, it keeps my son's interest, but i haven't seen any response to him watching the movie.","1391":"The songs were very catchy. My daughter seemed to really like and respond to it. The reasoning and logic are very much geared towards older potty trainers. I would recommend this video for older children in the 3 to 4 year range.","1392":"I got this video for my soon-to-be-3 year-old son who was showing interest in potty training.  I was encouraged by all the reviews which said their children were so inspired that they were trained the next day.  What do they say about something sounding too good to be true?  Anyway, my son loved watching this video--the songs are very cute and catchy--he sings them all the time--and he even peed in his potty a couple of times while watching the video, but he still insists on wearing diapers!  I would recommend this video, but don't expect an overnight training!!","1393":"I thought this movie would do the trick.  It seems great, but my daughter was NOT interested.","1394":"I havea 3-year-old son.  This video did not hold his interest at all.  The video itself seemed okay, just geared more for girls.  After about 30 seconds my son stopped watching.  The video is designed around a princess, and I thought the songs were a bit cheesy.  I'm sad I wasted my money, but everybody's different, you might like it.","1395":"After reading such positive reviews on this video I had very high hopes for it to assist me with the daunting task of training my son.  He does love the video and wants to watch it often, however, it does NOT make him want to use the potty.  He just likes the music.  I am still hopeful though for it to work...I just wish it wasn't so annoying for ME to listen to!","1396":"I bought this for my 26 month old grandson but he is clearly not ready, yet.  No fault to the content, it is for children a bit older.  We will bring it back out in about four months and try again.","1397":"It has catchy tunes and my daughter likes it a lot.  I didn't like the \"Jester\" character in their play, it is really creepy these days that an adult male (other than the father) is dancing with a three year old girl after she learns how to use the potty.  This character should be eliminated, maybe they should have used a fairy \"potty\" godmother instead of this guy that isn't funny at all.","1398":"my 2.5 yr old twin girls had no interest in this dvd....and they love watching movies. it may work for some kids but unfortunately not mine.","1399":"I bought this for my 2.5 yrs old daughter.  She didn't really go for this dvd.  She likes the Elmo's Potty Time much better.  It isn't as well-produced as some others, but the songs are cute.  Potty Power did catch the attention of my 9 month old son, but he isn't in need of this instruction yet.","1400":"It didn't work for my [..]child at all. The child sings the songs but it has not motivated the child to try potty training.  I also didn't like the part where it says big kids sleep in beds and babies in cribs.  It confused our child who has no desire to stop being called our baby...so being a big kid and not a baby is no reward for our baby.","1401":"I bought this video because i'm starting to potty train my 2 year old daughter. She watched it once and thats it. She liked it but she didnt seem interested on it, like i thought she would.","1402":"I had heard great things about it from another mom.  She talked about how much her little boy liked it.  My kid thought that it was ok.","1403":"My son watched this video, but really couldn't relate to the princess plot. It is advertised for boys and girls, but I think it is geared mainly for girls. I can't recommend this video for potty training a boy.","1404":"It is a doco of making porno at the dawn of the legalizing a business in Hollywood.  Sometimes funny, sometimes rude, this work is just of doing cinematographic stuff as usual, leaving authors' porno for X-movies.","1405":"You pretty much know what you're going to get when you sit down to watch Damnation - that is, if you're a fan of the franchise.  Like earlier CG offerings, the tech is good and the action is jam packed.  You're not going to have your life transformed by this movie but you WILL enjoy yourself for the duration...if horrific mutation and the questionably undead are your idea of enjoyment!  And really, what's not to enjoy?","1406":"So the first animated Resident Evil movie was good, this was not quite there, but thoroughly enjoyable.  I recommend this to any other Resident Evil fans!","1407":"This is not a US release. While it purports to have some extra features: alt bank robbery opening, 3 trailers and a documentary the only one I could actually get to work was the commentary. Picture quality is mix. There is noticeable artifacts throughout and the entire film has a green tint compared to the special edition DVD. However blacks are super rich, though the entire disc is mastered dark.","1408":"The transfer is actually pretty good. The movie itself is quite dated but entertaining especially if are a comic book fan. If you loved the movie the first time by all means buy it. If you like Kurt Russell, have not seen the movie, are not really a comic book fan, and can't really imagine Kurt in a dark role, it may not be a film that trips your trigger. It really didn't work for me.","1409":"While showcasing the best picture for the film yet, the Blu-Ray version of the film lacks everything else. No extras at all, no commentaries, no comic... If you are a videophile, this is the best version, but if you love this film you need the DVD collector's edition.","1410":"This movie at first was starting to evaluate the stars,afterwards the rest of movie was thrilling and suspenseful. Halle Berry very good actress.","1411":"This movie was so BORING...up until the last five minutes. I'll have to admit, though, that those last five minutes were GREAT. I just wish the whole movie would have been that good.","1412":"In my opinion not the worst film I've seen this year but not the best from Halle Berry or Bruce Willis. A few unexpected twists the acting can be a bit wooden at times but worth the watch. The Blu Ray transfer is not too bad but there are better films to show case the hi def experience.","1413":"Investigative reporter Rowena Price (Halle Berry) is trying to track down leads in her friends murder. Suspecting that it might be, business man\/philander Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), Price goes undercover as an employee in his advertising agency. What could have been the typical suspense movie, ends up being a decent thriller with a twist at the end. There is everything that would make a story interesting...blackmail, suspense, romance, etc. And I'm not saying that Berry deserves an Oscar or anything, but I did enjoy the movie, and think that you will too!","1414":"A fine flick for watching the talented Miss Berry, and the story has some good twists & turns.  Bruce Willis does an interesting turn as the lecherous boss, though he seemed under-utilized.  Clearly it was Halle's movie.  Mr. Ribisi also found an interesting character, not your typical computer nerd.  However, the plot was so dark and sordid, I felt I had to take a shower afterwards.  I wouldn't recommend it to the tenderhearted.","1415":"For most of the movie, the storyline seemed to drag along quite a bit. It almost lost me until the ending, when it seemed like 60 minutes of information was given to you in 10 minutes!! A good thriller, but very slow in my opinion...","1416":"Perfect Stranger is a strange movie. what I couldn't understand was when Bruce Willis accused of a crime he didn't commit why didn't he protest. He didn't say a word and let the courts send him to jail. But Hallie played a good psycho. the ending will surprise you!","1417":"The Bottom Line:  A fairly standard, if dirtier, teen flick, The Girl Next Door is almost completely forgettable and not worth seeking out unless you're seeking disposable entertainment.","1418":"After reading the reviews here I decided this one may be worth watching. It was entertaining and held my interest but it's a little overdone in spots and certainly can't stand up to Risky Business which it rips off very blatantly including using a lot of the same lines, many of the same sounds in the music track, and even the same type of voice over at the end wrapping everything up. I liked it as entertainment, certainly not as art.","1419":"Mildly entertaining but entirely forgettable unless you are a teenage boy.","1420":"I received my DVD quickly but it was loose in the case and was somewhat scratched. If there is a way to secure the DVD inside the case please attempt in the future","1421":"I WANTED TO CHECK WITH ANOTHER FRIEND WHOM HAS THE ORRIGINAL CINDERELLA AND THE COLOR IS DIFFERENT ...ALSO A SCRATCH ON THE CD.COULDNT CONTACT THE SELLER..WAS SENT NO PAPERS WITH THE CD..SO ALITTLE UNSETING","1422":"I received my copy of Cinderella, only to find that it was not an original copy and was defective.  Abundatrade did work with me to remedy the situation in a timely and professional manner.","1423":"I bought a used Cinderella DVD. It worked fine. The cover seemed like copy paper. It did not have a barcode. Decent Shipping.","1424":"Given as a gift to a three year old granddaughter. Timeless theme of good versus \"evil\" in a great story.","1425":"Bought the DVD for my granddaughter and gave it to her last weekend.  When they opened it to watch they noticed that it was different from my original copy.  It seems it is a homemade copy.  DVD worked ok and my granddaughter doesn't know the difference, but I am disappointed.  I don't believe it said anywhere that it wasn't an original copy.  If it did, I sure missed it.","1426":"I will never buy a movie from Amazon sellers after receiving a black market copy... I will only buy from Amazon itself!","1427":"The DVD and case were in good shape...  but there is a little glitch that causes the movie to skip about 2 min in the middle.","1428":"This is one of Disney's best movies!  My grand daughter & I love it.  The problem is that the DVD sticks or stops often.  We have to wait for it to continue.  This is rather distracting.  We have the same problem with another recently ordered Disney movie. Other movies seem to play just fine.","1429":"I got the video very quick within 2-3 days so that part is great.  However, the cover of the CD case looks kinda phony for a Platinum edition so I don't know if it's an original CD or a copy.  Compare to my other Disney CDs I get, the quality is a bit off.","1430":"I was disappointed in the presentation of the purchase. It came in a plain DVD holder with very small labeling. It is a gift so it will look shabby in presentation. I have yet to preview to be sure the condition is as stated.","1431":"I was a little disappointed because this movie turned out to be a replica of the real movie. It's just a copy, and it's not what I expected but for the low price that I payed, I guess it's okay. I wouldn't buy from this seller again.","1432":"As a child I loved this film but when i watch it now it's not the greatest film. Even as a grown up Disneys films are still great liek Bambi and other classic films butt his film is good but not a great film. The film iss still a classic but it's hust old. The new dvd edition is great with lots of special fetures.","1433":"Although this DVD is crisp and beautiful, it is a shame that Disney chose to alter the color of Cinderella's dress through out the ball scene. Her dress should be silver, as it is when her fairy godmother created it, and the color changes to blue in the moonlit scenes. But, in an effort to justify it's vast merchandising of a blue dressed Cinderella, Disney has chosen to alter the color in several indoor scenes, so that the dress is seen to be blue more often then silver. Why couldn't they just restore it correctly?","1434":"The first time I saw this movie I walked away thinking &quot;i never want to see that again...&quot;  The reason why was that this film leaves the viewer feeling depressed for days.  Although the plot has it's holes, it is ultimately unimportant.  It's the characters themselves that make this film.  Both Duvall and Kellerman are captivating while the protagonist embodies that little part of us all that wants to just disappear from time to time.  It's not a great film...it's good though and it will stick with you long after the credits roll.","1435":"Ok Movie, But Not Very Funny, Good Video Transfer, Very Good Burt Reynolds Performance, Also Marilu Henner, Along With Julie Andrews.","1436":"Very ordinary. Interesting only for young Mel Gibson and Sam Neil. Catch it on TV sometime.","1437":"I did enjoy this movie, though mainly for its action. The plot is somewhat  unrealistic helped a little by good acting. To the producers credit, the  film flows quite well and is easily followed by any audience. All in all  its a decent film so long as you dont expect too much.","1438":"I enjoyed the movie but wished it stayed closer to the novel.  As the saying goes, the book is better than the movie.  Still was worth watching","1439":"Rating system should be 1-10 and I would rate it about 4 for acting 6 for special effects, 5 for plot, and 4 for photography. I can't believe that the best they could do in rome was a few fast brush strokes with fountains in the car chase scenes.","1440":"A disappointment. Not nearly as good as The DaVinci Code. Not a good title for the show, leaves you expecting something very different. Just a plain old cop show, basically.","1441":"The DaVinci Code got me started so I bought Angels and Demons.  Cant say I enjoyed it as much as the DaVinci Code but it was quite well done and good in its own way.  Now I will be curious to see another one and hope they make a lot of them.  There are many more they can do if someone knows what to do with the information.  Try Angels and Demons, you might love it more than I did.","1442":"It's far fetched but it's entertaining and suspenseful in some scenes. I enjoyed it.  I don't want to watch it the second time though.  I've never read the book this movie was based on. I'll try to read it later.","1443":"Look for a movie review elsewhere. Personally, I thought the movie was 4\/5 stars. No extras worth mentioning cost it another star, so I give it 3\/5. What a waste of Blu-ray space. I've seen more extra content on DVDs.","1444":"This is a decent movie, but the book is ten times better.  Ron Howard took a lot of liberties with this movie.  I just think the book is so much better than the movie.","1445":"Disappointed in story line - all they do is run around chasing \"clues\" from improbably easily found sources.","1446":"This movie was a bit long but ok.  Maybe I was not impressed with this movie because I read the book.  Rent it first and add your own opion.  I wish I had rented it first.","1447":"I enjoyed this film more then the first. I think Tom Hanks was better in this second instalment.","1448":"I just didn't find this movie all that interesting. It just wasn't exciting. In fact, National Treasure was better than this movie could ever hope to be!  One man has been called in to help solve the mystery behind the kidnapping for four priets. They rush around trying to solve the mystery using clues from Catholic historical books.","1449":"Got to see it finally.  This movie must have been made around the time National Treasure was made when driving around chasing clues was the thing in movies, only National Treasure was a better movie.  Rent it, watch once and forget.","1450":"The question unanswered in this movie is whether it was good for Christianity or not. (Roman Catholic especially} There was an inner battle going on relative to faith. The acting was superb. Is there anyone better than Tom Hanks?","1451":"this move was ok but it wasnt what i expected i was expecting something like the first one the thrills and the chills left the first 10 mins of the movie they talk alot in this movie. the only thing  i can suggest is buy it at goodwill if you find it there but dont be in a hurry to get it","1452":"At least this film isn't a total plodding nodder like The Davinci Code was. This one at least has a bit of life in it, a faster pace, a tighter window of time, and not quite so much dwelling on the symbols or mysteries.  Tom Hanks and Ewan MacGregor do decent work for Ron Howard.  It's a decent diversion for an afternoon's viewing.","1453":"This movie is much like Da Vicni code, but there'[s enough differences to keep the two from being copies of one another. I haven't read Angels and Demons, but given how much I enjoyed Da Vinci Code, I should enjoy this book as well. The movie was very enjoyable - if you like Da Vinci Code, you should like this, though I thought Da Vinci Code was better.","1454":"OK-- just know what you're getting here. You're NOT buying this for the acting, script or other Oscar categories.  You're buying this because it shows women beating each other up.  Not so much boxing as landing 19-20 unblocked punches to the opponent's head or gut; each punch -judging by the sound effect-- would drop an elephant. Each boxer does a creditable job of grimacing, suffering and sweating. Way too much &quot;plot&quot; gets in the way here, but on DVD you can pass up the grease and go right for the meat.","1455":"I like the movie but like I said by watching it on vhs there are some scenes that were cut. On dvd all scenes will be seen, but the price for the purchase of this movie is too high. I would have loved to seen a better ending for the movie. I think the producers should have put in a better profile and background about the killer who helped his friend. Other than that I always liked watching this movie. Drop the price of the dvd and you'll have a lot people purchasing the movie including me.","1456":"I wouldn't buy this movie but I probably will end up recording Meryl Streep's scenes because her portrayal of a Catholic School nun is PERFECT.  There are just days when you miss the voice of justice and black and white sense of morality is the ultimate in shrewdness.","1457":"This film is highly overrated, and just gives Streep and Hoffman lots of scenery-chewing and overacting to do.  I love them both, but this film seemed tailor-made by Hollywood to be a \"sure thing.\"  The ending was very forced, and not very effective.  All in all, not that great.","1458":"The Bottom Line:  Doubt works much better in its quiet moments (Viola Davis's scene springs to mind) when it eschews the thundering acting that works better on the boards than on the screen; the film is still worth seeing due to the convincing nature of the performances (exception: a weak Amy Adams) and several worthwhile scenes, but this trivial piece of Oscar-bait will not be remembered for very long.  2.5\/4","1459":"Doubt was an okay movie. Some parts were slightly tedious.Admittedly, there was perhaps one or two scenes that had a lot of strong feeling and done very well.It's one of those movies that you will watch once but you don't want to watch it over and over. It is definitely an unpredictable and unique movie and the actors did an incredible job.  BubblesReviews.com Rating: 3 out of 5","1460":"Interesting viewing but was not all I expected from a Meryl Streep film. It seems to be slightly over rated.","1461":"I think in general the actings were reasonably good.  The plot was a cheap shot like the writer was finishing up the story in a hurry at the end.  Not a movie that will make a strong impression.","1462":"The film definately shows Meryl Streep's rich acting. The movie was thought provoking. Projection can be so perplexing. I love Amy Adams and her sweetness in all the roles she takes on. I know this will be short. I think what I liked the most about the film, was how the pastor reached out to the little boy who felt so alone and seemingly hurt. Whether their was an agenda in play the kindness did feel tangible in Philip's acting.","1463":"The DVD sticks at different points during the movie.  You get what you pay for.","1464":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001PA0FFO\">Doubt<\/a> Intriguing with many twists; however, you are left at the end to decide the fate (guilt or innocence) of Father Flynn and what role, if any, the Catholic Church played in consealing him or not.  Depends upon your choice of outcome at the end of the movie.  Realistic.","1465":"I really expected it to be better overall.  I'm not Catholic, I was raised in a very religious home and went to a religious private school.  I rejected Chrisitianity as a whole, and maybe that's why this movie failed to touch me.  The acting was good, but it just seemed lacking.  Not for me.","1466":"It was an okay movie.  Some funny moments.  But with David Spade and John Goodman in it, I just thought it would have been better.  It is a good kids movie - I guess it was the adult in me that was disappointed.  Usually these movies appeal to both kids and adults.  This one didn't do that.  My kids don't ask to watch it too often either.  Maybe they didn't like it as much as I thought either!?  Rent it.  1smileycat :-)","1467":"This is a good movie but the it could have done without the narration.  My kids like it because of the llama.  Some more singing and dancing and I believe they would have truly loved it.","1468":"The animation looks rushed. The basic idea is good but seems to have been pushed through to completion too fast. It does offer good clean viewing for kids but adults and teens might want something a little more intelligent. This cartoon is okay, but nothing special, although Kronk comes close to stealing the show.<p>Keep in mind, I'm a demanding viewer. You may like it a lot more than I did.","1469":"The \"Emperor's New Groove\" really is a neat little movie.  Usually Disney has the same plotline that they just repackage every year or so, but this movie is a total break from that.  To say this movie is quirky is not telling the whole story.  It looks more and feels more like an independent arthouse movie.  The animation is sleek and modern, and the script is extremly clever.  The Cast fills the roles perfectly,  Don't miss this movie!","1470":"There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, but it just seems a bit flat compared to the first one, not to mention the original animated version. If your kids just can't get enough of the first and you're dying to see something new, this is not a bad movie. But of the 3 \"Dalmatian\" movies (animated, 101, and 102), this comes in a distant third...","1471":"and as per some of the other reviews, probably not for most Americans.  If you appreciate British culture, can understand the accents, and\/or like dark, English humour, then this is a definite must see!  Funny, off-beat and low-budget, it's definitely a little different in all the right ways.  If you're not so much of an Anglofile, then I hate to say this, but you just won't \"get\" the movie: all the nuances, production style and jokes which make this a unique and brilliant comedy will unfortunately pass you by...","1472":"If you haven't seen Dumbo at least once, you should. It's a touching Disney classic. I've seen it many times and though it's not my favorite, it has some really good scenes. Unfortunately the streaming quality wasn't the best when I rented it.","1473":"I don't know why Disney is doing this release, they have deleted some of the \"Making Of\" documentaries and bonus music videos that were on the \"60th Anniversary Edition\" DVD release.  The few extra shorts on this disc were also on the previous \"60th Anniversary Edition\" DVD.  Bottom line: Get the 30th Anniversary DVD release if you still can.","1474":"The Bottom Line:  A very short (~60 minutes) animated film by Disney that lacks the scope and ambition of the studio's more accomplished efforts, Dumbo isn't bad per se but it's a rather unimpressive story that will appeal more to children than their more-discerning parents.  2.5\/4","1475":"I did not catch that the image shows the packaging is in Spanish.  I thought the title was misspelled.  I think that should be clearly stated in the product description.  The actual disk should work in English, so I will keep it.","1476":"This was a gift for my Grandson. I was embarassed to learn it arrived all mangled and the case broken. The discs were ok but since it's a special edition they like the cover and case to be intact. Hopefully they can figure out how to exchange without too much hassel.","1477":"I saw this video many years ago as a college going student actually. Even at that age I loved the movie and I still find myself humming the song 'See an elephant fly'. A superb movie of which I don't remember much except that  it moved me so much.","1478":"It is Disney,so it entertains kids well.But..this is definately not disney's best.The story line is sparse and the flow of the action is jerky.The music is memorable and my son enjoys them all except for pink  elephants on parade.It goes on too long and the animation that goes with it  scares him.Worth owning,but not a must have.","1479":"I am not denying how great this Disney classic is.  And I will be buying it on June 6.  What I don't understand is the recent increase in price.  These DVDs have gone from averaging around $21.99 to $29.99!!!  That is a huge difference.  And I would bet that the day after it comes out, the price will drop, which seems to be the trend on Amazon lately.  So what is the incentive to pre-order these anymore?","1480":"The movie I received has unremoveable, english, subtitles. Well, I normally watch my movies with subtitles, but for someone who doesn't, this could really pose a problem. I tried everything to take the subtitles off, to no avail. So just be aware that there's a possibility that you might recieve a dvd like mine, with unremovable subtitles.","1481":"I was glad I found this DVD, we've been looking for it for a while. Overall the quality of the video is not that great, some fuzziness, probably because we played it in blue ray.","1482":"This wasn't a terrible Disney film, but for me, it wasn't one of the better ones, either. The story is inspired from Oliver Twist, with Oliver as a kitten and the Artful Dodger as a street-smart dog. Like in the book, Sykes is the real bad guy, and in the movie he is a scary gangster. However, I can't say that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did others. Some people will love this movie, others won't. Eh.","1483":"I must say that Oliver &amp; Company is a pretty hip movie about a cat finding a gang of dogs to hang with.  The story and music are good, but I felt that this movie was just a little too short.  It needed more footage and a little more action as well.  Overall, this is a movie that everyone should see once or twice.","1484":"My 2 year old daughter likes this movie and does watch it occasionally.  The story is similar to that of &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, but where I can watch Tramp and Lady singing and romping around over and over and over again, I find duchess and her kittens all a little too sweet.  The songs are OK, but they get annoying after a while.  There are better movies out there.","1485":"The cat movie to 101 Dalmatian's dog story, The Aristocats is a fun and cute movie about a family of lost cats finding their way home. They encounter lots of eccentric animals along the way, from fellow cats to a pair of English geese on holiday.  Unfortunately the cats did not get the Platinum Edition treatment all the more popular classics have been getting. The picture is grainy and sometimes oddly sketchy. There's no second disk of delicious extras to pour through either, just the bear minimum.","1486":"The movie was not great, but it was okay. I watch many movies with my daughter, and many repeats, but this one will probably not get picked as often. My daughter felt the same way. It's not a bad movie, it just lacks excitement. It could have been written to be really funny, and the writer could have made the characters exciting. It does have a few really funny parts in it. This could have been a great movie.","1487":"For people intrigued by marionette manslaughter the first three movies of this series are the only ones worth checking out. Released in the early 90's at a time when the horror genre was weak, Charles Band's stringless assassins provided something a little different even though the idea now feels dated and quaint. As for the rest of the sequels, they morphed into ridiculuous cartoons sooned to be teamed up with other \"Demonic Toys\" that made up the Full Moon \"empire.\"","1488":"HOW MANY FILMS ARE IN THIS SET? I wish the Amazon had a little more detail on the content of the DVD's.","1489":"Read the other reviews for more insight into Season 3...I will just add that as a 40 year old man, season 3 made me long for season 1! Season 3 is pure crap! My 5 1\/2 year old daughter, enjoyed all three seasons, even this piece of crap!!! So if your like me...Someone who remembers this from the 70's...Buy Season 1 & 2 for yourself. Don't buy season 3 if you don't have kids! If you do have kids, get it. Just cause kids are still too young to know just how bad it really is!","1490":"the third season of land of the lost adds too many human characters just about every episode. it lacks the eeriness of the first two seasons, and the interest as well.  it resembles kroffts more childish work in the third season,  but it is still the original land of the lost so it's still great. undeniably part of the legacy.... if you are a beginner to this program, start with the first or second season before getting this one.","1491":"I wish I would have looked at all of the reviews closely.  The seller says nothing about this movie no longer having an active digital copy.  Since I bought the movie exclusively so that I could have the digital copy it was a \"let down\" when I discovered the fine print on the packaging.  DO NOT make the same mistake I made...If you are buying this for the digital movie insert - keep walking.","1492":"As action films go there is action.  That is fine for a big screen TV, but not worth the theater screen fare.  Honestly, T1 & T2 were the best in the series and should have stopped there.  All those that followed are just confused, inconsistent messes. Yep, the action is there but plot, story line, dialog, and acting are...well...never fluid.  This film with McG and Bale prove it.  If you want action it is here, if you are looking for rebirth of the franchise and substance...no it is not here.","1493":"The film Terminator Salvation, has some good points to it, and some bad points, as well. Plenty of action, good visual effects, we see more about the machines, John Connor's character, as an adult is more developed. Now, for some of the bad points, it's still the same Terminator story, being retold again, compared to the first two films, which were, fresh and original, when they came out. The other characters' in the film weren't so interesting, except, maybe, Marcus. The story isn't resolved by the end of the film, either.","1494":"For Terminator Fans, of which I am one, this was an entertaining movie.  It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening. It was the best of the recent man vs. machine genre movies.  There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things.","1495":"I have purchased several Blu-Ray movies through Amazon and I have always been very satisfied with the Delivery time and Quality of the Blu-Ray DVD's until I purchased this one, I ordered this Blu-Ray DVD at the same time I ordered 3 other Blu-Ray DVD's and this one took an extra 10 day's to arrive after I received the other 3 Blu-Ray DVD's.","1496":"Not near as good as I was hoping. Thought it would take place right after Sky-Net took over not some years down the line. I hope one day I'm good enough to twist a few wires on a car that has set for years and am able to start it within a minte or two. ;)","1497":"Christian Bale and Sam Worthington star in this 2009 sci-fi film. In 2018, John Connor rescues his father with a cyborg's help. This is pretty good and Christian is great as John. This dvd has nice picture and sound, but no extras. I still recommend this.","1498":"Lots of action, but terminator2 still the best. T1is a classic action film. Ok but not as great as previous terminators.","1499":"Movie does well on its own.  The sound on the blu ray is some of the best I've heard, Transformers1-2, Dark Knight, Iron Man, the picture is great but the movie looks a bit drab, it's meant to look like this I assume.  The director's cut is the best way to watch the movie as the original has some poor editing.  Kyle Reese is played well but I did not care for Moon Bloodgood.  Good not Amazing.","1500":"I guess I expected more from this movie after all the terminator series I've watched.  I just wasn't that impressed with it.  As always though there was great service from Amazon.","1501":"The special effects are really good.  Some of the story is good.  But overall, it seemed inconsistant with the other Terminators.  The ending was corny.","1502":"I fell asleep after about of hour of watching this movie....it was ok i guess looked great on blu-ray but as far as the movie goes....nowhere near as good as the other 3 terminator movies","1503":"didn`t think, i would ever say that. this edition is a joke. in the german version you get another complete skull head from a t-600 (like in the 6-disc edition) !!! and not just a face","1504":"How about getting James Cameron and Christian Bale together for a remake of The Terminator and burn the rest of the Terminator history. We can ask for a bad version with McG and Schwarz. The two respective groups fit perfectly together.","1505":"Terminator Salvation is the weakest of all the Terminator films, with one exception: Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright - he is terrific. He's even better in Avatar. And this year, he stars in Clash Of The Titans. Something to anticipate. Besides Wright, the film is pretty much just a lot of noise and special effects that don't add up to much. Even Christian Bale is the weakest I've seen him. It's almost as if he knows Wright is stealing the film away from him, and there's nothing he can do about it.  Waitsel Smith","1506":"In regards to DVD Extra's, you have to buy the 2-Disc Edition at Target. It has the same extra's as the blu-ray edition. So if you don't have a blu-ray player, go to target and get the movie there.","1507":"3 stars because I like the movie, but the Director's Cut is as the others have stated. Maybe 3 - 5 minutes of some added scenes but not enough to make it a movie changer. Personally I think they could've kept it at a PG-13 rating...","1508":"A real tear jerker.  Went through a box of tissues.  If you are looking for a movie that will touch your heart this is it.  Fantastic performance from Kristen Stewart considering her young age.  Loved it.","1509":"I read the book for this DVD and I wanted to watch the DVD to do a comparison betweeen the two. I thought the book was better. There were parts of the book that I thought they should have added in the movie. never the less I did get a kick out of watching Kristen Stewart before she was Bella.  Marlene","1510":"The movie wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped. Very low budget and slow paced. There wasn't really much motivation to keep me wanting to watch the movie or stay interested.","1511":"Interesting to see where the American version came from.  Some of the exact same jokes are used. The odd thing about the possible lay-offs is that they bring in two temp workers.  Why would they do that? It makes no sense.  Perhaps that is the point.  Features a 'How I made the Office' doumentary which provides some insights and a little paper program to explain who everybody is which is helpful.  Also some deleted scenes that were mostly just unwatchable. Pointless.  I wondered if they were just made-up to appear like they were deleted.","1512":"I have to say that I love \"The Office\" and silly me didn't watch it from the beginning and I'm sorry I didn't! It's great to see Steve Carrell with less hair (shock!) and looking a bit more, um, sleazy.  From Diversity Day to the Handbag Girl, this is a great beginning.  I can't wait to get the remaining seasons.","1513":"Only had a couple episodes, which were OK. For this series, they do get better as they progress.","1514":"I really liked the office when I bought this season. It was very funny, and I enjoyed it very much. The only problem that I had was that it only had a few episodes, actually less than I had expected. It's still great if you like the office.","1515":"I started watching The Office during the 3rd season on TV and love it. The first season however, is WAY over the top. Michael (Steve Carell) is beyond stupid in season 1. I am happy to say I get the impression that he starts to tone it down a bit by the 3rd season.","1516":"Season one must have been a filler show- there aren't many episodes in this dvd.  But it's fun to see how the characters have evolved from the first episodes.  Recommended for many laughs, but not for younger viewers.","1517":"My favorite thing about the humor on this show is how real it is.  The awkward moments are painfully humorous.  I don't know if everyone will enjoy it, but I expect most people planning on buying this dvd have been watching the show on tv already.  Three stars b\/c there are only a few episodes on the dvd and it has questionable mass appeal.  The case on this dvd is of good quality, so that made me happy, too.","1518":"Not bad , but when will American TV\/ movies come out with original material instead of once again borrowing from the rest of the world?","1519":"Recently I started watching the office on T.V. At first it is hard to swallow, but a couple of espisodes in and your hooked! So I bought season 1 and thought it was pretty good. I will probably buy season 2 to continue. I travel a lot and it provides laugh out loud comedy on a repeatable basis.","1520":"How many times do we see successful British comedies fall short when they are adapted to US TV series. There was no major changes to the original storyline and what made the British series of the The Office was Ricky. Get the original and get season 2 of the US","1521":"Some good laughs come out of the first season.  However, by the end of Season 1 [and especially season 2] the show begins to run out of ideas and instead of \"The Office\" it becomes the \"Ricky Gervais Comedy Show\".  Also, like the other DVDs of \"The Office\" this is ridiculously overpriced for the amount of material on the DVD.  Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars.","1522":"Adapted from the original series \"The Office\" as set in Slough, England, written and staring Ricky Gevais as the office manager. This is the American version, which upon first viewing made cringe worthy viewing after having intially watched the original English counterpart.  However, afer watching several episodes the unique location and style of Ricky Gevais's comedy shines through and the programme is as compelling as the original.","1523":"The English version was a lot better With Ricky Gervais but I would say that I'm English. It's so good because people do take themselves that seriously in some offices.  I took the English series of the DVD to my friend in SF way back in 2002 and it went down very well. Didn't get it at first but loved it after the first episode. It was refreshing as the only British comedy she'd liked - or possibly seen - before that was Monty Python. Which is little before my time...","1524":"This is not the 1st episode of the Alvin show it is actually the Chipmunks short from episode 8, the Crashcup short from episode 6, and the musical segments from episode 3.","1525":"When I was a lad in the late 40's I saw DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK at a small theatre in Canonsburg, Pa in black and white.  I was surprised recently to discover it was in Technicolor.  Did film studios send color films out to small theatres in the hinterland in black and white?  Also the 20th Century Fox film BELLE STARR was in black and white when I saw it as a kid, but it was also filmed in color. What gives?","1526":"Drums Along the Mohawk is very entertaining movie with excellent cinematography, but alas it is somewhat dated, and the portrayal of Indians in particular leaves much to be desired.  It would seem that the inspiration for Blue Back (played by Chief Big Tree) was Buckwheat from The Little Rascals.  I couldn't help but cringe each time he was in a scene.  It's a shame that such portrayals were once deemed acceptable.  Aside from this, however, the movie does have its merits and is worth seeing if you're into historical films.","1527":"Drums Along the Mohawk is a perfect example of films of that era that paid no attention to history and created and reenforced negative stereotypes about American Indian people. I use this film in my American Indians in Film class as an example of how inaccuracies and negative perceptions of American Indian people were created.","1528":"I love the series sooo much but unfortunately at the end it starts getting a bit disappointing.","1529":"it shows the way different people belive what could happen to us in the coming years","1530":"Being a James Bond fan, I couldn't favor this one really. Even though Roger Moore deos excellent, the plot is so non-existant, and Octopussy is ugly.","1531":"having all the potencial of being a good picture octopussy fails on all levels first it suffers from bad acting axcept for louis jordan who along with exotic localls saves this picture from a 2 star rating second a weak plot something that also killed moon raker also roger moore was far to old to play bond by this point why he wasint replaced is anyones guess a problem that killed another bond picture a veiw to a kill.","1532":"The audio quality is poor.Im looking forward for another release,digitally remastered in 5.1 audio or DTS.","1533":"This movie was alright but the soundtrack was awesome. &quot;All Time High&quot; is great. Roger Moore who was 53 didn't do a bad performance. I was impressed with the number of villians in this movie greatly directed by John Glen. The most famous scene is the beginning and the scene where Roger Moore is a clown. I recomend it more than A VIEW TO A KILL.","1534":"Octopussy has got to be the best title for a movie I have ever seen. Roger Moore is truly at his best in this campy portrail of James Bond. The stunts were in the confines of Roger Moore's age.  That's what made the action  believable.  It has some of the best action sequences to date.  The movie,  as a whole, was unrealistic, but none of the Bond movies really are.  In my  opinion this is the best Roger Moore movie.  I really enjoyed it and  despite the name, it's fun for the whole family.","1535":"The photography in the DVD is beautiful.  However, it really is just a slide show of photographs to some lovely music.  There are definately some great photos, but if you are looking for some narration and info about the area this dvd doesn't have it.","1536":"I got this movie for my kiddos to watch.  I was a little surprised by 2 of the scenes in the movie that I don't remember from when I was a child.  One in which there is smoking of cigars and the use of a sensitive word.  Yet overall is a classic that I remember from my childhood.","1537":"A real classic for sure.  It's well worth it to read the book first.  The story is of far more substance than the movie portrays, but the movie is a wonderful little sketch comedy and vignette with amazing artwork, animation and music.","1538":"I love Pinocchio but it is not worth paying the extra cost for this DVD just because it is Disney. There are NO extra features except trailers. How disapointing that Disney feels they can charge 10 or more dollars extra  just for the priviledge of owning this on DVD. It feels like they are  punnishing us for not buying the video which has more extra features on it  then the DVD!  How sad. I would not buy either and complain to Disney  about their sneaky tactics! I am a huge Disney fan and can say this!","1539":"When I was a kid, I loved this movie so much I wore out two VHS copies of it, even though Monstro scared me silly. But watching it again now more than 15 years later, I have to wonder what I found so special about it. I can't really describe it, but I just feel so \"blah\" towards it now. Monstro is still pretty frightening, but that's the only part of the movie I like anymore. Maybe it is just me, but this movie is not as good as many of the others Disney has done.","1540":"Well, I love this story, its very classic and I was excited about getting it. The movie arrived fast in great condition, but it seems as if someone took it off of the vhs version and put it on DVD. There were no previews, the picture quality was ok. But since this movie was about $6 to $8 what can I expect. I got what I paid for!","1541":"I really expected more from a Blu-Ray release.  Though the PQ and Audio was as good as you can get for a film that's been released for almost 70 years.  I was very disappointed with the film not being able to fit a widescreen TV and would have to include side curtains to cover the side borders.","1542":"Great movie.  Poor DVD.  Brand new and it skips and gets stuck in about 5 places throughout the movie.  Was a little disappointed that a new product would come that way.","1543":"All of the disc were NOT in the case.But  I was fully refunded..And Very,Very satisfied with that..thank you and that will NOT effect any future purchases from Amazon..Amazon stands behind their word \" 100% Satisfaction OR A Full Refund\"....Thank You again...Rosie Davis","1544":"I purchased this for my little grandsons.. love the movie and the quality .........my main disappointment is the fact there is so much other stuff- new movie reviews before the movie starts it is a real pain..some are too scary  for pre-schoolers and I have to FF to get it set for them to watch.. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001ILFUDC\">Pinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition)<\/a> why can't they just make \"\"THE MOVIE\"\".. isn't that what we are paying for and buying anyway??","1545":"Great movie...but if you are expecting a coupon for a free childs fare from Amtrak as they have advertised on their websight....don't bother...it is not there and Amtrak claims no responsibility and will not compensate","1546":"I'm a grandmother and watching the video took me back to my childhood days.  I bought Pinnochio for my four year old grandson--the animation is old technology--not of the quality young children have come to expect... it frightened him and did not hold his interest. I do not recommend it for small children...","1547":"Disney took the cheap way out by releasing this movie in 4x3 full screen format instead of one of the widescreen formats that Blu Ray disks are normally released in. This is the only Blu Ray disc I have seen in 4 x 3 format. I returned the Blu Ray disc because I refuse to pay Disney's premium price for a non widescreen Blu Ray of Pinoccio. I hope Disney re releases it in widescreen because it is an excellent movie.","1548":"While the actual Disney film, surprisingly enough, the DVD was in Korean with English subtitles and also in poorly dubbed English with Korean subtitles.  The Korean language version was superior. As this was the only true Disney verison of Pinocchio I found available on DVD, something was better than nothing (to the person for whom I purchased the DVD).","1549":"The 1940 classic &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is one of my all time favorite Disney films. Created with no computer animation, the film features the talents of Dickie Jones (Pinocchio), Cliff Edwards (Jiminy Cricket),Chistian Rub (Geppeto), Walter Catlett (J. Worthington Foulfellow) and others, and that wonderful song (&quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot;) the film remains a beloved classic since its creation in 1940, which means the film was made 63 yrs ago! The 3 pt. rating is because the DVD offers no bonus features but the 1940 trailer.","1550":"I remember seeing the American version of this movie and thinking that whoever designed her cloths was wonderful.  Everything else just seemed like a dream with a few 'slasher' film images. I will have to revisit, it has been over 25 years and I have since read enough about the film to see it with different eyes.","1551":"If you are a collector of blaxploitation films add this DVD to your collection it is the basic blaxploitation film nothing really great a few actors\/tress that people may be familiar with if you grew up in the 70's;however it was made by Quentin Tarantino and I am not a big fan of his. I like maybe two movies that he made.","1552":"This is a solid and nicely-produced yoga routine for beginners. I would rate it more highly if the title had not led me to expect a more vigorous workout.","1553":"I think this tape is too slow to get a good workout.  It is good for strengthening and relaxation, but they stay in the positions too long to really get my heart rate going.  My personal favorite is still the Crunch Fat Burning yoga tape, it moves quickly enough that I feel like I'm doing some exercise...","1554":"What's great about this video is that you can choose your fitness level and the camera focuses on that person.  You can also choose one of four 45 minute sessions, or do them all for a longer workout.  Unlike other videos, this one allows you to skip ahead and search chapters, which is great.  Now, if you're new to yoga or very inflexible, this would be the perfect yoga video for you.  However, if you're fairly advanced, or looking for a challenge, I would pass on this one.","1555":"I love Susan Deason's verbal pose cues and commands.  However, I was very frustrated that I could not access the Personal Instructor Feature on this DVD.  When I saw that logo in the bottom right hand corner, I pressed \"enter\" (as the instructions direct you) to no avail.  Next, I tried every button on my DVD remote - to no avail.  I emailed Gaiam about this 4 days ago and have not yet received a reply.  That truly does NOT impress me.  Buyer beware with this video!","1556":"I thought I was limber enough to do this but it does all levels of intesity and I couldn't keep up with the positions. This is a good video for those who are more advanced in yoga than myself.","1557":"I guess you get what you pay for, this dvd is horrible. The quality is terrible and appears to be recorded from a video camera filming the movie displayed on a projector. The Sante Fe Trail is one of my favorite movies but due to its lack of \"political correctness\" the studios refuse to remaster and release an official version. I would avoid this dvd and hope for a official release sometime in the future.","1558":"Nice DVD with some great moments in preperation of the concert. The movie shows what the show was all about and gives you a small experience of experiencing Michael Jackson up close and personal.","1559":"the selected product is required, but definitely lacking in details such as a booklet to enjoy the maximum value of the object. as a whole is positive.","1560":"...play on words jokingly for a Just ok, behind scenes pre-concert prep stuff; dont have more to say about it, @ least for right now.   (i generally like j5 & especially mj-some music & vids of his; of course they both also have good, timeless music between them.)","1561":"The picture was not very clear. I went to the movies to see This is It, the video did not do the movie justice","1562":"Having a lot of good, international memories of Michael Jackson, I bought this with the assumption that I would get some full videos of his past performances.  This did not happen....only sketches.  That disappointed me.  However, this is a good video for those who wish to go into the entertainment field to discover how a good performer gets that way...by practice, good ideas, precision, and in MJ's case, kindness to all who supported his endeavors.  You don't have to be a monster of a boss to get results.  (Supervisors, managers, directors, ceo's - take note).","1563":"This show received so much hype, I guess I was expecting too much.  It was just OK.","1564":"I bought this on sale over the holidays.  It was decent, but I guess I was expecting more out of it in terms of telling the story of \"This Is It\" and I expected more performances to listen to on my home theater sound system.  It's just OK in my opinion.","1565":"HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THIS.  ONLY COULD WATCH ON CERTAIN DVD PLAYERS.  FIRST ONE NEVER WAS VIEWABLE.  SECOND ONE, I COULD WATCH ON A PARTICULAR DVD PLAYER.","1566":"This Blu-ray (movie) is a thinly discuised way of extracting money from Michael's fans. He looks frail and out of it. He has no lasting energy and looks like the only thing keeping him going (beside the constant \"stroking\") is illicit. This is not a fitting tribute to his legacy. I couldn't help but think as I watched... that had he not succumb to a tragic overdose now, he probably wouldn't have survived the exhausting concert tour ahead of him. (another great performer seduced by the dark side)","1567":"There's really only one song worth buying this cd for, otherwise just get his albums which are much better. I guess this is for people new to Michael, but I'm sure all his diehard fans that have everything he's ever made are buying this one as well when they don't really need it.","1568":"I was glad I found this DVD, we've been looking for it for a while. Overall the quality of the video is not that great, some fuzziness, probably because we played it in blue ray.","1569":"This wasn't a terrible Disney film, but for me, it wasn't one of the better ones, either. The story is inspired from Oliver Twist, with Oliver as a kitten and the Artful Dodger as a street-smart dog. Like in the book, Sykes is the real bad guy, and in the movie he is a scary gangster. However, I can't say that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did others. Some people will love this movie, others won't. Eh.","1570":"I must say that Oliver &amp; Company is a pretty hip movie about a cat finding a gang of dogs to hang with.  The story and music are good, but I felt that this movie was just a little too short.  It needed more footage and a little more action as well.  Overall, this is a movie that everyone should see once or twice.","1571":"A dated crime drama made palatable by Henry Hathaway's documentary-style direction and James Stewart's determined Chicago reporter. \"Call Northside 777\" (1948) marked the beginning of the actor's harder-edged screen persona - thus paving the way for his  collaborations with Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock. Though predictable and slow-going at times, Stewart's compelling performance holds the film together.","1572":"This film is a great example of American film making in the 40's, the remastering is superb and no perceptible loss of quality, it views beautifully on my wide screen LCD TV, this film is definitely part of my permanent collection. I only give it 3 stars as the story is pretty far fetched, but the filming and quality is superb.","1573":"Never So Few has a good cast, great cinematography, and a terrific Hugo Friedhofer score. It also has Gina Lollobrigida at her most beautiful. I can't understand why there are so many complaints about her in these reviews. She does what she needs to do most admirably. Seems she has always been under appreciated. I thought the romantic scenes were a good contrast with the war sequences.","1574":"Don't bother buying this when you can get it from your public library. This has nothing to do with the popular scifi series. And before all the so called academics (used loosely)lose there wits, I watched it knowing exactly what it concerned. My opinion is if it interests you watch it but I don't believe you should buy it.","1575":"Interesting concepts and analysis.  Long dissertation, with much information covered.  Must have patience & an open mind.  Concepts stem from Mayan calender and related topics.  Looking for answers?  This will reveal some very unique beliefs.  Again, come with an open mind.","1576":"Tapes looked very good on outside.  When I played the tapes, unfortunately, they would freeze at a certain point, and I have to fast forward to get them to start again.","1577":"I was basically disappointed about getting the full screen version.  But that was my fault.  On a bright side the movies are very enjoyable, each has great sound and excellent picture.  The extras did not impress me, had a couple instances where it would pause in the middle of the extras, fortunately it did not happen during playback of the movie.  I guess Universal needs to get there things together.  i give it three stars..","1578":"I bought this because I was searching for a song we sang in elementary school choir, \"So My Sheep May Safely Graze.\"  This is the ONLY recording of the song I have been able to find, so I was very happy to have found it. Brought back many happy memories. Enjoyed listening to the other tracks as well.","1579":"The game is in it's entirety without commercials. There is no pre or post-game stuff though.  The video quality is so\/so, but you probably won't find better since over 20 years ago!  Commentary is from the broadcasters and is good.","1580":"I just bought this DVD at the U.S. Post Office, expecting to see a clean digitally re-mastered Rudolph... to my surprise, the DVD I have has lines and spots, as if copied from an old film strip.  I'm very dismayed and confused.  Doesn't sound like others are having this complaint, so did the Post Office purchase pirated DVDs for resell?  Strange...","1581":"This product was listed as New which it clearly was not.  There was no seal and the item was loosely shrink wrapped. The paper dust cover was ripped.  However, this was for my family and not a gift so we kept it.  The dvd played in fine condition and did arrive in a timely manner.  I would caution anyone ordering this item as a gift. Rudolph is still a classic and we all enjoyed it very much","1582":"You would think they would have cleaned up the video before releasing it on DVD.  Unfortunately though, all the original lines, dirt and lint are flying throughout the show.  And no color correction either. Too bad.  Otherwise I would've given the video 5 stars.  It's a classic, but the DVD looks like a poor transfer VHS.","1583":"Where the heck is the Rankin\/Bass production credit jingle at the end of the show????<p>You know..the white &amp; blue Rankin\/Bass logo with that catchy and memorable 60's Rankin\/Bass sound clip that is at the end of the cartoon!!<p>Sony Wonder......You goofed BIG TIME here!!<p>Otherwise....Rudolph's great as ever, every Christmas!","1584":"If you liked the book, you probably wouldn't enjoy this movie that greatly.  There was a great deviation from the novel by Charles Dickens.  However, I think Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow had a lot of chemistry and  they showed that to the audience through the movie.","1585":"I bought this because I was searching for a song we sang in elementary school choir, \"So My Sheep May Safely Graze.\"  This is the ONLY recording of the song I have been able to find, so I was very happy to have found it. Brought back many happy memories. Enjoyed listening to the other tracks as well.","1586":"I wish I had rented first. I threw ten dollars away when I purchased this. The narrating was horrible..VERY disappointed.","1587":"Amazon seems to be quite regularly passing reviews from one release of something onto other releases.  They used to tell you this, but now they don't.  There are 2 sets of this - one Winstar (older version, with re-dubbed sound effects and really bad Pan & Scan) and THIS ONE, which is the Bosko Diamond edition.  I haven't seen either, and now I certainly won't be using Amazon's reviews to get a feel for what the release is like, as I can't trust them to keep one edition separate from another.","1588":"In this score, the talented actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, even in his early career, reveals his talent and love for what he does. It's a must see, since it's a story of internal quest about the way we should live our life without spending it worthlessly.","1589":"the shembeckler girls, especially jodi, played by karen lynn scott were amazing. seeing her in that one piece pink bathing suit made the movie worth watching. should of had more of her and the rest of the girls in the movie. throwing that sax in the pool was a cool scene. sure she was rude and snotty, but who cares she was so good looking, oops!","1590":"Dolora Zajick is amazing and blows the roof off the house as Azucena.  Pavarotti's voice rings like a bell. Sherrill Milnes is incomparable. If you could only delete Eva Marton this would be 5 stars.  But it is still worth purchasing just to Dolora Zajick sing &quot;Nostre Monte&quot; and the final scene with pyrotechnics and all.","1591":"This was the video of an old performance of Il trovatore.  Well worth the price.","1592":"For the person that cannot handle Battle, a black woman, as Pamina, I would like to state that opera is fantasy.  People do not break out in spontaneous song at the drop of a hat.  Therefore, it is easy to allow Battle to play the part of a character that was originally written for someone who is white.  I don't think Mozart would object.  What is important is her singing.  Go back to Nature Shows if you can't deal with it.","1593":"This is one of these movies that had the potential to be something more. But when defeating the alien involves a huge puerile and dirty joke, it simply can not reach that level.","1594":"Back in 1999 I read the spec script when Evolution was originally written as a serious horror science fiction film, two years later the film was released and was totally changed.Evolution is meant to be nothing but a fun flick and that what is. The film is in the vein of Ghostbusters and has very funny moments. Seann William Scott makes this movie for me though and it's a shame he still hasn't got that break through role. The action sequences and direction also make this a good film. Check it out for a good time.","1595":"What can I say.... Evolution is a comical approach towards the evolution of an alien species which come to earth on a crash landed asteroid\/meteor!!  This movie gave the producers a unique view as to what creatures would look like on other worlds and the result & special effects were perfect. I really enjoyed this movie but I am still waiting for that monster movie that is rated 18 or adult to see exactly what monsters get up to out of the view of kids!!! Still worth adding to the collection.","1596":"Anything with David Duchovny is worth the time watching :). Sadly, I ended up LOSING my time with this flick. The storyline was fun to watch because it gave a lighter side about aliens and outerspace other than the series X-Files usually protrays (which happens to be my all time favorite series). The only thing that bugged me was the sexual innuendos. I can handle movies that have that and violence, but I can only handle so much! Had it not been that way, I would have considered giving this movie 4 stars instead of the 3.","1597":"Watchable, if only for the novelty of seeing Fox Mulder not being Fox Mulder.  I vaguely enjoyed the concept but found myself in the second half just waiting for it to end.","1598":"Despite the director's previous experience bringing alien slime and ectoplasm to the silver screen in his earlier hit, Ghostbusters, this movie, although it doesn't fall flat, isn't in the same league as Ghostbusters.<p>Still, it has its moments, and there are some very funny scenes. But although the movie gets off to a quick start, it sort of drags in the middle, but then it picks up toward the end again and the climax with the aliens' final destruction comes off pretty well. Okay for a video rental for a slow night.","1599":"Dave Duchony has a dry &amp; droll wit. Julianne Moore is cute in any thing she does. The monsters rapidly evolving were good in their supporting roles. The rest of the cast wasn't as funny as it was stupid. I enjoyed the movie. It could have been better if it didn't lower itself to that vast consumer market: 12 year old boys who still think that fart jokes are funny.","1600":"This movie was halirious! In fact it was the only movie I went to see twice in theaters! <p>The actors\/actresses were fantastic, Duchovny and Jones, being my favourites. A very funny, well-written sci-fi comedy. It reminded me of Ghostbusters, but a slightly different style. All the actors were amazing in this film.(David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William-Scott, Julianne Moore).<p>Also, there was great special effects throughout the movie.<p>I reccommend this movie, very much!! A must see!!","1601":"...but the rest of us split our sides with laughter. Amid the grim debate on the validity of darwin's theory, Mr. Reitman has produced a comedy. The plot works because the romantic leads play straight while the supporting cast \"hams it up\". The skillful use of animation and FX bring the story to life and we iscover what would happen if evolution was suddenly very fast.","1602":"A stupidly funny movie .... I like it. If you like movies like Senseless, Half Baked, Dude Where's My Car you may like his one. Made for entertainment purposes only!!!","1603":"You get it all...Tiger Wasps, Fruit Tree Maidens, Demon Lizards, the Silver Scale Serpent, Herb Wanderers, Flying Vampire Demons and fireflies.  This fun fantasy adventure is a good popcorn flick.  If you don't speak the native language, be sure to set the sound up with the English track.  It may be too gory and violent for young kids...and a little scary with all of these killer creatures.  3 stars.","1604":"not bad some cool effects not your oscar winning performance and movie in overall but very entertaining and watchable","1605":"The audio is not in sync with the video; this detracts from this video.  Are all copies like this or did I purchase a bad one?  I purchased through Amazon from an independent supplier.","1606":"This is not \"traditional yoga\", the presenter jam packs his positions into a short time period. It is good to show a lot of positions, but I personally just picked out my favorite ones and do them without even watching the video anymore.  This DVD will be all up to your personal taste. A little hyped up and over priced in my opinion.","1607":"Entertaining enough, if sometimes a little dull. Acting is generally good.  It lacks real pazazz somehow. It's really a prep for sequels more than anything. I particularly enjoyed Jackman as Wolverine & Anna Paquin as Rogue.  Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly did a nice job as well.  I found the first part of the movie more interesting than the last half where all the fireworks take place. It won't knock your socks off or give you fond memories, but it will provide a nice piece of entertainment for an evening.","1608":"I loved the movie, although, this is region locked to the US. Blu-Ray players or PS3 systems bought outside the USA will not play this movie. I made that mistake. Oh well! Free gift to someone.","1609":"meh. Don't know much about X-men, and this didn't really enlighten or addict me. Decent action movie I guess. Good acting.","1610":"This movie was pretty good. I definitely have seen worse however, I expected the fight scenes to be greater than they were. I didn't really see Storm, Cyclops, or Wolverine utilized to their fullest capabilities, and certainly not like the cartoon.","1611":"Although I'm not familiar with the X-Men comic books, I found the film to be rather entertaining.  The acting was much better than I expected, and the storyline was well defined and moved quickly.  The special effects and action sequences were particularly well done, with a few &quot;standard&quot; action movie one-liners, but with minimal cheese.  I found Halle Berry to be totally miscast as Storm, and her acting was the weakest, although she had a very small role and not much character to develop.  The ending easily allows for sequels, so I expect there will be more.","1612":"The special effects almost make this movie a keeper--however the lack of attention to the actual comic series leaves true fans with a lot to be desired.","1613":"This was an OK Movie. I was expecting a little better but ffrom 1-10 I'd give it a 7. Unless you're a die hard fan, it isn't a must see movie!","1614":"I was never much of a fan of the X-Men comic book (I'm waiting for the live-action Spider-Man movie next year), but I have the admit the creators of this film did a pretty good job.  The story is intelligent and fairly interesting.  The special effects are impressive without being overbearing, as they were in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.  I did find the Rogue character a bit dull.  Wolverine is the standout of the picture, with his wisecracking attitude and ferocious fighting style.  The DVD edition has plenty of special features that should keep you busy for a while.","1615":"The movie was good ! I actually didn't pay to watch it cause I fininshed watching one movie and went to another which happened to be X-Men. I say they needed characters like Gambit, where's Gambit !?, Beast, Juggernaut, etc. Why would they add a guy like Toad in the mix !? I hear a squeal soon !","1616":"The X-Men movies are fantastic. The first being wonderful character-developing platform which re-launched the comics-to-film genre after Warner Bros killed it with the horrendous \"Batman and Robin\". The second being the typical rollercoaster action event with little plot, but multi-layered fight scenes and huge explosions.  Fox's greed at cashing in on X-Men is rediculous. X3 comes out this summer, and fan furor will peak again, but why would fans want a bare-bones disc? especially considering most people have the two disc sets already (the original X-Men release and the 1.5 release) a third release is downright insulting.","1617":"A little disappointing but OK.  Didn't do the mutants' reputation very much good overall with the general public.  My least favorite of the three X-Men movies.","1618":"Cheesy-factor is through the roof. Hollywood loves this sort of thing. There have been a bunch of other good comic book films and comic-bookish films over the last five years. This one falls in the middle of the pack: better than the worst of the Batmans, and worse than Spiderman.","1619":"This movie is awesome!","1620":"While three stars may not seem that big, I must admit that this is the best comic book to movie screen adaption ever.  Even better than superman","1621":"Cheesy-factor is through the roof. Hollywood loves this sort of thing. There have been a bunch of other good comic book films and comic-bookish films over the last five years. This one falls in the middle of the pack: better than the worst of the Batmans, and worse than Spiderman.","1622":"Being a huge booster of Blu-Ray as the ideal (so far) medium for improving the sight and sound of older movies I was fairly disappointed with this and HD Cinema's concurrent release, \"Kansas City Confidential\".  While Blu-Ray transfers typically make details sharper, shadows blacker and faces more detailed, these two films' details seem softer and less focused despite the BD transfers.  Ironically, this can be proven by watching the short side-by-side comparison each disc offers as an extra feature.  The non-Blu-Ray half of the screen looks sharper with more relief.  First time I've seen that.","1623":"This Star studded movie is outstanding but this Blu-ray version really isn't much better than the DVD version also included in this Combo-Pack.  Very blurry for Blu-ray but okay as a regular DVD.  Only extra a trailer & restoration comparison.  Orson Welles, Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young are outstanding and this movie is classic, to bad the quality is not up to Blu-ray Standards like \"KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL\" is.  Good Luck!!","1624":"For a digitally re-mastered dvd, the quality was poor:  sound and picture both.  I was very disappointed. I have seen this movie on tv, and the quality was better than the dvd.","1625":"Though nicely presented, the Silver Screen Collectors edition may have two minutes cut. They list the movie at 93 minutes but different (even discount) editions of The Stranger run 95 minutes.","1626":"Most reviews dismiss these cheap releases because they aren't the best possible. So what? I don't care. These are perfectly watchable and a great way to preview a film you might be curious about, but not sure you want to spend the big bucks on, for the restored, remastered, pristine copies. Don't be intimidated by the geeks, bless their hearts.","1627":"Very few pretty boys are any good at playing gangsters.  Warren Beatty is not one of them.  And Annette Bening is much too shrill.","1628":"It was a good movie, it fits well among these types of crime films mixing fact with fiction. The extended version adds to the interest.","1629":"Honestly I didn't see where this movie was that bad.  My favorite parts are the beginning, when the mother and daughter duet.  I'm still waiting for that little girl to make a album.  Was that her actually singing?  And the club scene where Billie\/Mariah funks up \"Funkin' For Jamaica\" was totally flawless. Truth be told I bought the movie for those two scenes alone.  It was worth the 10 bucks I paid for it, on VHS.  Watch it for yourself, you be the judge.","1630":"the movie isn't as bad as the critcs said. it has a great love story,a good plot and the songs are great. what else do u want in a movie?? this movie isn't great or academy award worthy but its nice and funny. if you're too cheap to go for a screening go buy the dvd or don't get off your lazy butt and buy it from the web.","1631":"I was pretty ticked at the way critics bashed Glitter. It's far from award winning cinema, but it's tolerable to some extent, and also somewhat enjoyable. The 80's feel and old school music make it that much better. You don't have to be a Mariah fan to enjoy it. And in my opinion--HER acting wasn't the problem. It was her horrid costars that needed the lessons. Just give it a chance before you completely write it off.","1632":"I checked this movie out because I had nothing else that I hadn't seen already(well...) I gave it 3 stars because it was better than I expected. But the idea that to people could write the same son when they are apart is just to cheesy. I'm not saying that you wouldn't like it but the ending did have me in tears. This is not the type of movie that leaves you feeling happy. It leaves you with an empty feeling inside.","1633":"My son received this DVD for Christmas and I recently reviewed it. The movie was exciting enough, with good 'ole Tom doing his thing, but the basic premise turned out to be totally false! There was no Minority Report! Really, people, how far down the garden path do you intend to lead us?","1634":"While most people in the reviews have voiced their opinion of the plot of the movie. I would like to point out that this is one of the noisiest DVD titles I've seen. While viewing on an LCD projector the grain is so overpowering it distracts from the movie. I have to applaud Lucas with Star Wars II and the superb transfer to DVD which as virtually no noise.","1635":"This was a good film that could have been much, much better.  My main criticism, and I won't say much about it because I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, is that there were too many plot holes.  Things would happen, and I'd say to myself, \"How can that be? Wouldn't such-and-such happen?\"<p>The film has a great premise, good acting, excellent special effects, and some intriguing philosophical questions.  Unfortunately, the plot just doesn't hold up.","1636":"But I'd suggest the police station disable the security clearance of suspects. No less than three times Tom Cruise (and his wife) were able to get into the most sensitive areas of the police station using his eye balls. In the remake that will follow in the next ten years, I'd recommend closing this plot hole by having the protagonist use acrobatics to enter the police station. Include laser trip lines and pressure-sensitive floors without discretion.","1637":"A respectable attempt, tainted by clean sets and clean clothes and clean actors.  where are the drugs?  The scene with the typecast creepy doctor is just not enough.  this should be remembered as a TOM CRUISE FACIAL ACTING action suspense flick not a PKD movie.","1638":"I hate to say this because I really enjoy Tom Cruise movies (and he looks eerily like my little brother) but this movie was not all it was cracked up to be.<p>The plot would have been so much better than this.  So much better.  With just the right imagination, more chase scenes and intricate plot could have been added to fill in the gaps of the storyline.  <p>Rent it but only when it's on sale or you have a free movie credit.","1639":"After the obnoxious MI 2, Tom Cruise decided to work with a much better director than Jon Woo!! Enter Mr. Steven Spielberg,the master.<p>The movie is very good, fast paced and, more important, INTELLIGENT. It's not ultra-violent, much on teh contrary. It builds its momentum to a climax.<p>I enjoyed it a lot.","1640":"The three stars are for the packaging not the movie. This is a good Spielberg film and good blu-ray transfer, a sure four star rating. However, I am quite dissatisfied with the packaging and cover. This is clearly not the best looking cover. To make things worse I received my copy without the slipcover. I thought it would not bother me much but it does, the cheap casing sorely stands out amongst my other  better looking blus.","1641":"I've always been fascinated by Jack the Ripper so I figured this movie would be great. Too bad it lacked a strong story and good direction. Sure the imagery is beautiful but the characters are often stiff and lifeless. The story drags on a bit. It moves too slow and the ending is unsatisfying. Johnny Depp does not appear to be the great investigator you'd expect in this movie and Jack the Ripper fails to frighten even the towns people. It's not what I expected.","1642":"The Hughes's are two of the best African Amercian directors ever to direct. Their last film From Hell displays their talent for horror and suspense with his movie. The film plays it smart by not showing the killer's face till the end and the death's are never shown.Johnny Depp and Heather Graham both give winning performances and this film is very highly reccomned.","1643":"The mystery of who the Jack the Ripper was, assuming he still isn't around, is what has lead me to watch several documentaries and read several books all trying to solve the mystery. By the end of the dvd, my thought was, 'Disappointing'. There's some romance, which led me to think, 'Why is that there?'. The movie could have been about a fictionary serial killer. There are extra features, and a mini-documentary about the facts known and supposed I enjoyed much more than the movie. A movie that's not bad, just not great considering all the material available.","1644":"Not a bad film for what it's worth. The first time through I was maybe expecting more but the blu is worth a purchase.","1645":"For general entertainment purposes this movie is very good. However the audience must be cautioned that this movie is not historically accurate by any means. Abberline wasn't an opium addict, nor did he die at the end of the case (he live well into the 1920's). The murdered prostitutes never knew eachother, and the royal conspiracy theory is laughable at best. For a good weekend entertainment movie this film will certainly fulfill that need. This is not for the individual looking to learn more about the case.","1646":"To Jeff below: A very good review. However, you made an error in your historical facts. The potato famine of Ireland was in the 1840's","1647":"This movie was very dissapointing.  The coolest thing about the Jack the Ripper legend is that no one ever truly knew his identity.  The movie itself was very well directed and production design superb, but the plot declaring that the ripper was basically a government hitman and his murders just conspiracy cover-up took the creepiness out of the story itself.  Are Free-Masons really that wacked?  Don't know, don't care.  Maybe they will make a really cool movie about Saucy Jack someday, because this isn't it.","1648":"I have to give this movie 3 stars just because Depp is in it. I feel this movie would have been SO much better if Johnny had had a decent leading lady.","1649":"This film had alot going for it when it started but fell apart terribly at the end.  I have termendious respect for Johnny Depp as an actor and he has come a very long way.  Even though he was excellent in this film and he gave it his best shot the film itself died.I give Johnny 5 stars the movie 1.","1650":"If you don`t know anything about the history of Jack The Ripper is a good film, but if you know is a bad film. Jack The Ripper it`s a true story not a fiction like this.","1651":"The acting and filming are very good. Lighting is great.The acting is alright.This movie is quite good.Not historic. It's before all a fiction but the plot is well balanced. The only thing I didn't like is the 2 hours because It's pretty slow moving.For sure don't get this movie because you expect a true story or because you want to be scared.It's more kind of &quot;investigation &amp; suspense&quot; movie.","1652":"ONCE AGAIN,THE CURSE OF A HORRIBLE ENDING DOOMS THE WHOLE OF THE MOVIE!TRUTH BE TOLD,I NEVER READ THE COMIC BOOK OF WHICH THIS WAS BASED ON.I KNEW COMING INTO THIS THAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE MOVIE.WHAT I DIDNT,COULDNT SEE COMING WAS THIS CONSPIRACY THEORY OF AN ENDING.ATLEAST THEY DIDNT WAIT 4 MONTHS AND PUT THIS 2DISC SET OUT LIKE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY OTHER RE-RELEASES ARE DOING.AT ...,YOU CAN WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING WORSE,BUT I SUGGEST YOU EJECT AT THE 1HR\/50MIN MARK.","1653":"This is one of the coolest movies of all time in my opinion. Great suspense and great action. Arnold is great in this flick. The only problem I have with this movie is that they did a real poor job of remastering this movie for Blu-Ray. I'm hearing of that alot on these older films. Seems like there just not taking the time and effort into upgrading properly. It's a real shame, because wouldn't it do movies like this justice for full blown awesome picture and sound?","1654":"This is a great movie, certainly the best of Schwarzenegger's career. They did a good job with the audio on the new release with the 5.1 DTS, however the video transfer could use a lot of help. It comes and goes, there are some sections of the movie that look OK, and others that just look bad. I guess this will give them another future release to sell that will be digitally remastered.","1655":"WOW - one of my favorite movies and the transfer is only slightly better than the previous issue.  The DTS also is only slightly improved.  WHEN are they going to give us a high-def. transfer and remove the grain. If GWTW -1939 can be done, so can Predator.  SHAME on them all.  You wait, another one will probably be coming in the next yr. and we can all dump this copy to buy that one.  So - don't upgrade yet.  Wait for the pristine transfer we all know is coming","1656":"I've watched Predator a few times over the years.  I've always considered  it to be a pretty good and entertaining action film.  There's plenty of  action throughout, and the special effects are cool.  I also find the  acting from the entire cast to be solid and enjoyable.  Arnold  Schwarzenegger does a good job in his role.  Predator moves at a  comfortable pace and never becomes boring.  The plot of the movie is  satisfying, the being from outer space is fascinating, and the music is  also good.  Predator is worth a watch.","1657":"All the one star reviews are referring to the already released predator Blu-ray. It is agreed among the HD community that the other predator first edition was of poor quality in sound and picture. This release will probably have all the extras, hd surround sound, as well as lets cross our fingers a remastered print. So don't listen to any of the reviews prior to this being released. Once it ships check out Blu-ray movie websites to get a real review.","1658":"I have always loved this movie; however the audio on this DVD is less than satisfactory.  The sound is not in Dolby Digital which reduces greatly the enjoyement factor.  AMAZON.COM you need to sell better quality DVD'S.","1659":"This movie is okay, I don't why everybody say this is Arnie's best movie. The whole time Arnie and the monster are battling in the jungle is pretty tiresome. I would say the best part is Arnie's troop and the enemy's troop fighting, not the main monster battling part.","1660":"bad picture, bad sound for collectors editionn. addons not realy good.","1661":"A powerful compelling film about a woman suffering the tortures of Jesus Christ.  The atmosphere this movie invites us is dark and the camera work was very well done.  But overall the film is quite predictable and yes, its  ending is a revisit to the frightening room of Satan in the Exorcist.  The  soundtrack to this film is amazing.","1662":"It's about a priest who goes on a date. Nothing special, just obviously changed. Good, things are back to normal.","1663":"I enjoyed the movie very much but was extremely disappointed in the sub-titles.  They were not shown throughout the movie, were inconsistent and sometimes displayed in a foreign language.  I was also disappointed that the movie was produced in wide screen format only.  It was not as pleasurable to watch on a full screen t.v.  The content and quality of the DVD was excellent, however.","1664":"This movie makes you think and question what one might believe.","1665":"Daredevil had the makings of an excellent movie.  To bad the director didn't know that.  The camera work was the pits on this one and the ending was way to unbelieveable even for a superhero fantasy.  A hero who is too injured to help the love of his life, but can beat up two (yes, count them please--two) bad guys? No way.","1666":"this a step down from x men and spider man but its still good. tis could have been ten time as more better if they have had added about 20 minutes but for now this will do. good fun super hero fun","1667":"I was expecting crap, but this is decent. The actors are good in their roles and there's plenty of action and lots of good moments. The CGI sucks so you've been warned. Affleck played a comic book artist in Chasing Amy so I thought it was interesting to see him as a comic book hero. Affleck wants Kevin Smith to work on the sequel and it'd be cool if Smith wrote it, but I guess we'll have to see. I wont hold my breath, but it's a good idea.","1668":"and have a 6.1 or 7.1 system then you'll really want to see and hear this film.  I have a THX 7.1 system and even though i thought the film was lacking in all aspects, the sound is out of this world.  I'm not a fan of this kind of film, it was fun to watch but not really worth the money to buy. The extras are kind of a waste of time but the 6.1 is well worth it.","1669":"The best thing about the movie was the casting of the villains. Michael Clark Duncan was perfect as Kingpin (even though Kinpin was originally white) and Colin Farrell certainly made Bullseye the movie's most unforgettable character.","1670":"The movie stars Gigli as the masked crusader Daredevil. A lone vigilante that believes in 'the greater good'. He fights Alexander in his best performance ever as Bullseye. Rent this nice action movie but not worth buying because it gets old quickly.","1671":"I was looking forward to this film because I am a huge fan of Marvel movies and I really really loooved spiderman so i thought theyd make this one just as good , although this movie was good i think it fell short of my expectations maybe if spiderman was never made this wouldve been better but spiderman raised the bar but this is still a good movie. In conclusion unless you absolutely love this comic book don't buy this or at least rent it first .","1672":"I would have enjoyed this DVD more if there were more concert footage.  The behind-the-scenes coverage just makes Lars look like a mentally deficient jerk who didn't get his ass beat enough as a kid.  The Sandman and Unforgiven video clips and sound are very good.","1673":"An Italian family prepares for an upcoming wedding. The recipe for disaster: 3 fighting sisters, 2 family squabbles, 1 ex-boyfriend and a partridge in a pear tree. Add a splash of Italian culture to the subplot and stew. This movie is equal parts trite and entertaining, but the cast is surprisingly good with standout performances by Jonathan Schaech and Talia Shire. In a not-so-clever twist, one sister brings home her lesbian lover (Alyssa Milano) simply for the shock value. By the end of the film, the outsider shows everyone who's the boss. -Cynthia Gunnells, CeleGAYtions","1674":"Our 7 year old and 2 year old girls enjoyed this immensely, and the colors are brilliant.  They were easily entranced by the emotions of the story.  I was a little disappointed to see how stilted the movements were for a \"dance\" film.  I would have hoped that they would have worked that out from previous Barbie installments.  This is safe entertainment for little ones with a bit of classic theater, dance, and music education thrown in.","1675":"This was a good kids movie.  My daughter loves it, but I don't think it was as good as the other Barbie movies.  The plot was a bit weak and the story line was old.  But, I guess the dancing in it overrides it as the kids like it.","1676":"I rented it hoping it would possibly be true to the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm...boy did I set myself up for failure on that one!!! I recommend reading the story first so little girls don't get disappointed later when they DO read the original story and find that while the Barbie title ...well had the same title, but didn't stick with the story.  I felt this way after reading the Little Mermaid *after* I saw the DisFlick.  The original story is much better and the ending is more poignant.","1677":"This is a great movie for a seven year old girl enamored with Barbies and princesses.  Don't expect that anyone else in the family will be crazy about it.","1678":"Global supertars Charles Napier and Hoke Howell headline this tale of aliens in computer-generated ships gone mad! The amazing thing about this movie is it's scope (or lack thereof). We see snipets of cartoon ships blasting city-scapes, while 99.9% of the action takes place in a prison van, a sheriff's office, and a cave! Actually, this works fairly well, although it could have been about 20 minutes shorter without losing much \"suspense\". So, go ahead and watch, knowing that it could have been far worse...","1679":"Closely follows \"Gilligan\"s Island\" storyline in that there are \"Maryann\" , \"Ginger\", \"Mr. Howell\", etc characters, trapped on an island. Only differences are that this movie is funnier!  Man-eating plants, people who do stupid things when confronted with danger, a terrible lack of kickstands and chain smoking all lead to a pretty silly movie that was not even filmed on Hydra, one of the reasons we started watching the movie.","1680":"If you don't like 'talky' movies, skip this one.  Loved the characters but when all they do is talk through the entire movie about nothing, I kept hoping it would get better.  Then again, I don't like 'talky' movies.","1681":"I was amazed at how much dialog the main two actors had to learn for thie movie.  It entirely consists of them talking.  Got old after awhile.  If they had shortened it, it would have been great.  I fast-forwarded through some of it.  Beautiful scenery.","1682":"It looks ok, but the video quality is not, even for a mid size (42 inch) LCD, instead go for the blue ray for the best experience","1683":"this product is okay. it definitely does not replace a real fireplace. if i had to do it all over again i probably would not buy it.","1684":"I usually love Bette Midler, but this is so overdone and shmaltzy. She is so much better without a script. I turned it off before it was over.","1685":"Bought so I could get some ideas on things to do with the body bar, and thats about all I can use it for. The workouts are difficult and fast. If you are in great shape already then it is fine, otherwise I would not recommend except for exercise ideas.","1686":"I am an Elizabeth George fanatic, and while I enjoyed these films, they were not as good as the books.  It was adjustment seeing Inspector Lynley as a blond, but the gentleman playing the part does an excellent, excellent job.  Helen Clyde is a disappointment---role should be played by someone beautiful, vivacious and likable.  Havers is perfect---played very well.  All in all, I would highly recommend---especially for a rainy day---and lots of popcorn.","1687":"An off beat, metaphysical love story that sometimes strains its credabilty in awkward ways. BUT, the performances ave it from being a Lifetime movie or hack romance.  Laura Linney is just such an amazing actress.  Her face delivers all the lines that are never in the script and you feel whatever she feels.  Grace is very good and restrained in his role as the object of her affection.","1688":"I would consider myself an Adv. Beginner\/Intermediate exerciser, (work out 4-6 days a week) and I was physically incapable of even attempting some of the things Jillian does in this work-out. You definitely have to be an advanced exerciser in very good shape to do this work-out properly. She does have a few \"beginner\" modifications, some of which were still far too difficult. I'm not a complainer, I like a hard work-out... but not an impossible one! This is one I'll definitely have to work up to. Banish Fat was difficult as well but do-able.","1689":"I bought this video for specific areas that I wanted to work on and the only thing that I would like to have seen would be to have more specific breakdowns for certain problem areas instead of lumping them together in one category","1690":"I'm 5'4 and 115-117 lbs and consider myself pretty in shape, but I couldn't get through half of this DVD. I was using 5 lb weights instead of 3 lb ones though. It's definitely NOT for beginners. I'll try this DVD again after 60 more days of the Shred.. and only then probably once every week or two.","1691":"Tried to do this DVD on the weekend after leaving it wrapped up for so long, however I found it to be very abs focused with a lot of exercises that you really needed to be fit and thin to do to begin with.  I really didn't enjoy it and stopped doing it in the end.","1692":"I think this will work in the long run if you stick to it. I just started two weeks ago, and I haven't noticed any difference either in terms of weight or on the size of my waist line. But I'll keep going and I belive I'll see some difference maybe after two months??!!","1693":"Hello.  I have  bought this item in the last  month.  My opinion.  I find  the content good, but I could not  enjoy it because the poor quality in Video(image) and  sound. It is a pity that a good workout is been minimize due the bad quality of the item.  Claudia V <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001NFNFMQ\">Jillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones<\/a>","1694":"I actually first tried this workout video through net-flix AND loved it!!!! I ordered it because I felt like it was a really sweet investment.. the actual workouts are SO MUCH FUN... I always feel SO SORE the next day... i love to work out... video's dont normally float my boat: but LOVE this one!","1695":"The workout is good.  I'll give it that.  However, I HAVE to say something about her multiple pitches that we should invest in electric toothbrush x that cost only y amount.  Good grief, Jillian, how much money are you already making that you still need to pander for a corporation and slip their ad into my DVD?  I paid for a workout, NOT a commercial that takes minutes away from my already busy life.  Your greed is not too different from those of the 400-lb folks on the shows.  So...who is the biggest loser?","1696":"I love Jillian Michaels and this DVD is a great workout. I just have a hard time staying motivated at home. I'm a gym kind of person so I really can only stick to it a day at a time so I can't vouch for it getting rid of my \"trouble zones\"","1697":"Shes a bit annoying in her voice and looks but the exercises themselves seem to be pretty good.","1698":"Bitter Moon is minor Polanski, an overlong but enjoyable black comedy about sexual obsession. It's not particularly deep, but it is occasionally very funny (the poodle and the toaster are particular highlights), with Polanski constantly aware how close to comedy the sexual act is in all its more desperate variations. Perhaps its this sense of pervading black humor amid the emotional sadism that prevents the finale from having the sting it's aiming for, but it's an interesting voyage.","1699":"Does knowledge elevate us or demean us? Can you really just be  an observer with out being a active participant? Can the look champion the voyeur?<p>All these questions and more are dealt with skillfully by fantastic cast and crew.  <p>Rent it if you like twisted sex-thrillers and are not shocked by sexually explicit tales.  Rent it if you are in any doubt that we can devolve into animals at the drop of a skirt.","1700":"Can anybody tell me for sure if Benoit vs. Orton match from Summerslam 2004 is still there or had been edited out? I am a completist and that is a match I would not mind buying the entire PPV dvd for.","1701":"LIVING IN FT LAUDERDALE with all age groups, this concert or footage makes it on the screen from time to time and the viewer's look at it in aw,..wondering where they could buy the tape.  a  very good performance..!","1702":"This is the first compilation of the Spawn animated series. Its a bit slow in its plot. But very aggressive in its grasp of reality. A fan of hardcore anime or spawn would like this very much. The first tape mostly tells the story of how Spawn came to be and what his mission is, as he sees it. In  comparison to the 2nd and 3rd tapes it is a bit slow, but still  entertaining a good start to an excellent series.","1703":"Ben Loy is one of the first Chinese men in New York to marry and bring his bride back to America.  The old men, most of whom have their wives in China, are thrilled.  They see Ben's marriage as a new beginning for their  aging hamlet.  But the weight of everyone's hopes on his shoulders renders  Ben impotent.  His lonely wife has an affair and soon concieves a child.  The resolution is funny, but the acting is occasionally lackluster.  Still,  it is worth the trip.","1704":"SWAT is a good 1970s cop show.  The theme song is great.  I think Steve Forrest is a great actor.  I absolutely loved this show as a kid.  I have no complaint about this set.  I just haven't enjoyed the shows as much as I have other series such as Rockford and Hawaii Five-0.","1705":"I thought it was pretty good for its time period and the time it was made. I thought the actors were very good.","1706":"*** 1999. Directed by Sam Weisman. When I read that the estimated budget of this film is $40,000,000, I wonder where all the money went. I suppose Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese were well paid but, still, I'm sure there was some money left. I really don't understand why this enhanced stage play cost so much. Anyway, my kids loved the movie, my wife and I laughed two or three times and that's about it. In short, enjoyable but already forgotten.","1707":"Its hard to find a lot of comedys that get me  laughing-at least the first half.The latter scenes were forced and dragged.Very funny was the sex club scene and when they got on the airplane.","1708":"This movie is a poorly acted attempt at a musical.  The only redeeming part is the ending with the different high school classes performing their end-of-the-year presentation.  That, alone, is worth the money.","1709":"Interesting movie, i felt that there were a few things missing from the book.  Absolutely not a child's dvd. does show violence and a sadness. I did enjoy it though.","1710":"I was both impressed and disappointed in this video. It was much too basic for me and I bought it based on excellent reviews from other customers.  I found it slow and not what I had anticipated; too much at introductory level for one who has had many years of classical dressage background. That said, it would be great for anyone wanting to review basic seat, leg and hand work.","1711":"Someone loaned me a VHS tape of this flick and I enjoyed it enormously; however, the quality was poor.  Bought the DVD hoping it would be of better quality visually and, more importantly, have better audio quality.  I was disappointed.  The CD I bought is a bit better than the VHS tape, but not much.  It's still an enjoyable film, especially for those of us who enjoy singing in choirs!","1712":"This is ia very boring movie.  The cover appealed which is why I bought it.  Multiple story lines occur throughout which aren't related and then suddenly it seems the drama was all about nothing.  Mother Walton should have stayed on the mountain.  A movie I'm sure she's still trying to forget!!","1713":"If the overall discourse is concerning how religious intolerance provokes violence (e.g. Protestant-Catholic; Sunni-Shi'a; Christian-Muslim; Christian-Jew; Jew-Muslim; Hindi-Muslimi; Muslim-Buddhist; zealot-atheist) then this movie is an ignitor for such a discussion. If the discourse is personal revenge then the movie has some notable inadequacies. To carry an actable revengeful hatred for thirty years is not likely - five years, possibly, and that is a stretch. For a mother to heap the burden of guilt onto an eleven year old is also not likely. That this story unfolded with the characters being so storybook likable is also unlikely.","1714":"As a lot of foreign films, this one was unable to keep my interest.  I stopped it after 30 minutes, and have not finished watching it yet.","1715":"Greatly appreciate the purpose of the movie. I loved it; husband went to bed early. Depends on interest in Liam Neeson and\/or interest in Irish\/Bristish conflicts.","1716":"Bought this because Liam Neeson was the main character.  Not much in the way of action; just a current-day reasoning of Northern Ireland's troubled past.","1717":"Its ok Its definetely not a blockbuster story and film... but the story falls short with the ending leaving a bitter taste to such a tasteful start","1718":"nothing like i thought this movie would be like.... i read the reviews.. they must have watched a different movie than what i seen!!! hard to understand them\/F word over and over again...i think it had some good points to the movie... like -- when he was talking about we need to reach the children before they turn to gangs.. i agree with that 100%","1719":"Worth watching but not one that I will remember. The acting was good, but the story was only so so.","1720":"about this movie is the Bonobo tracks in the soundtrack.  The topic itself is interesting, but no real need to make a movie.  Reading the Times article would be sufficient.","1721":"I didn't give it five stars because it wasn't great, simple. But, it was very entertaining. I only recognized one actor, but that doesn't mean much.  It did have good acting and the action was pretty good.  Not Iron Man but still, all in all, a good movie. Worth the bucks.","1722":"This movie is good for Johnny Depp fans as the rest of the story is lacking.  Very shallow and although it addresses the supression of Christianity, it seemed lacking in story, character and purpose.","1723":"This is a movie that many find too slight, but it is nonetheless entertaining and a little touching. If you expect too much, perhaps the picture disappoints. If you take it for what it is--a pleasant diversion that reflects on the life's fearful tightness--then it is a small gem. Well worth owning.","1724":"As far as I am concerned, Johnny Depp is best thing in this film.  How sweet and handsome he is!","1725":"A cute story. It is worth seeing, but I would not recommend buying it. It is funny and touching at times, but not fabulous.","1726":"People raved about this movie and I sat there and felt like I missed something.  It was a good story line.  That acting was okay.  Some of the characters weren't really devolped very well.  It was disappointing.","1727":"This movie follows an increasingly common theme.  Men are pretty much all pigs.  The only meaningful intimacies are between women.  The Johnny Depp character is very shallow and superfluous and provides only an unconvincing heterosexual love interest for Juliete Binoche.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it's an engaging film and worth watching.","1728":"This movie is Rodney Dangerfield at his comedic best. There are two stories going on simultaneously in this light hearted golf comedy classic. One involves a stuffy judge, a golf semi-pro, a caddy trying to earn a college scholarship, and Dangerfield's character. All the bantering and competition ends up in a high stakes golf tournament. At the same time, Bill Murray, playing the green's keeper, is at battle with a gopher. The two stories collide with high excitement at the end of the movie.","1729":"After owning multiple copies of the video, I couldn't wait to see this DVD, I love this movie! I was very disappointed that the audio is only mono! I would have expected more from the 20th anniversary edition. This classic is begging for a remix.","1730":"I bought it for my husband for Christmas because he loves it so much. I enjoyed it a little. It's dumb funny so if you love that type of movie, this is a good one to watch.","1731":"This movie is not for everyone.  the humor is crude, the exting is a bit overdone, and there is a mechanical gopher.  there are some funny bits to it though and you will laugh if you don't get sick of some of the characters first.  all in all, if you haven't seen it, you probably should just to say you have. there is some good bonus material on this dvd as well.","1732":"Great story just go's to show you how schools and coaches push sports and great athelets over education and other kids. I love all the actors in this move.","1733":"When I got the DVD of this movie today, I thought, \"Well, let's see how Josh Hartnett does as a villian.\"  I was very surprised at how unlikable and yet sympathetic his Hugo was. Phifer was excellent as Odin and Stiles was good as always as Desi. Not quite a powerful as Oliver Parker's 1995 edition, but O was certainly more relevant after the Columbine shootings (the reason this movie sat on the shelf for 2 years).  I really became engrossed with the storyline and found it refreshing to see Hartnett play someone not so nice.","1734":"I have viewed this before and know it is a good film to use in High school to compare with Othello. However, I needed it for Australian viewing and it was the wrong region. This was disappointing and I will not buy any DVDs from this site unless I can be guaranteed of Australian region.","1735":"Nice production visually. Almost all the songs are lipsynced on this DVD. Some distastefully obvious. Britney performs her best striptease dance routines and displays enough cleavage for everyone.","1736":"Im a huge Britney fan but I honestly have to say she didnt throw in any extras for the money you spent. Seriously if you know someone who has HBO just tape it. I spent the cash assuming it would be like OTOWN where they at least say thanks for buying the video and show them a lil backstage but it wasnt. Being a Britt fan if you saw the show you already have seen the tape. Its ok if your obsessed but if you dont throw money away dont buy it.","1737":"Britney performs her hits and then some at Las Vegas, and the experience is somewhat uplifting. She sings: &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;Born To Make You Happy\/Lucky\/Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, &quot;I Love Rock 'N' Roll&quot;, &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot;, &quot;Lonely&quot;, &quot;Don't let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;, &quot;Anticipating&quot;, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, and &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;.","1738":"I would give her more stars if she really sang, all she did was lip sync. And the last part of the concert was a total strip tease. Britney and company should have more taste since Kiddies are at her concert.","1739":"I watched this at a friends house. That Britney the lip synched was no surprise. What I didn't expect is that every song was lip synched! It's a shame really. There is a highlight though: The backup band (did they even play before?) is set free during an interlude, and they really funk it up bad! If they did this for an hour and put it on a DVD, I'd buy that.","1740":"I really like Britney but I must confess that this is not her best show. Even the audience showed lack of entusiasm during the performance.","1741":"I got a DVD from this seller.  I was attracted to the price.  When I got my DVD... it was in a Blockbuster Box.  The DVD was in good condition but why on earth would you sell someone Blockbuster's copy of a movie?  That is all I have to say","1742":"I wouldn't spend a ton of money to watch it, or make a big production of its viewing, but it is funny. Snoop is very cool and there were a few parts that made me laugh pretty hard.  I would actually consider flying with that airline, even though I would belong to the Honky family.","1743":"As expected, the film is great, with a nice clean picture and sounds just awesome. The disk falls down on technical merit. The main glaring ommision, is the lack of a widescreen transfer! The extras are a nice touch, although  the &quot;making of&quot; is very brief. My VHS copy has a much longer  version on it. Shame about the tacky music during the menus though!","1744":"The excellent reproduction qualities offered by the DVD format, and the magic of an otherwise excellent, wonderful film, are lost in this unfortunate waste of time and money.  Why bother with a DVD without  widescreen and 5 channel stereo?  This DVD is very disappointing.","1745":"I didn't see this at the theater, but heard it was a good comedy so I checked it out through Amazon Prime. It was an engaging film. When Clint Eastwood isn't talking to chairs, he can be quite funny. And Tommy Lee Jones is a great compliment to Eastwood. Donald Sutherland is a great as well. I would recommend this one.","1746":"I just saw this movie and its been out, what a million years.  OK, its about some guys that are even older than me going into space.  This was a fun movie.  I love clint and garner, but to me the actor that stole the movie was Jones.<p>If you want to watch a movie that will make ya smile alot, go rent this one.","1747":"Price was great, delivery time was as expected but the product is of poor quality.  Only 3 of the 4 films will play.  I figured it was too much trouble to return it.","1748":"Some top-flight actors in a woefully predictable space walk.  When is Hollywood going to start using imagination again?","1749":"Great value for 4 movies.I am a big Clint Eastwood fan and I liked all 4 movies in this pack,","1750":"Totally likable film.  Tommy Lee Jones and the boys were just wonderful.  Always wanted to know the reaction to those test-flight jockeys who were turned down by the space program in favor of a monkey.  Watch their reactions, especially the actor portraying Eastwood...priceless! <p>For all of us who grew up with NASA this is a warm-hearted, salute to its pioneers and today's space scientists.  <p>The references to well-known space travellers: Shepard, Glenn and of course Yeager was much appreciated.","1751":"Guy Maddin's films are on the weird side like lynch or cronenberg but they hold their own. This film is not too weird but it has its moments. Great performances by Jason Patric and Isabella Rossallini. If you are a fan of his work check it out.","1752":"Much less than I had expected. Was hoping for some good summer terror, and it wasn't. Basically it was an entertaining but slow moving movie. It wasn't good enough for me to watch it again.","1753":"Spaghetti western collectors should know the Geneon release is a nice letterboxed, widescreen transfer. Colors are slightly faded and its non-anamporphic, but otherwise this is a fantastic looking picture for a budget label. Consequently, I was able to sit back and enjoy the film as intended. Actually it is quite funny at times, and nowhere near as bad as reviews would lead you to believe.","1754":"I LOVE this movie! My only complaint is that the extra\/special features (minus the cast and crew section) do not have sound...unless you pause the feature, start it again and then the sound is magically restored! Other than the quality of the extra features, I would generally give this movie 5 stars.","1755":"When item arrived we were alittle unhappy due to it not being JOHNNY DEPP'S chocolate factory, but as we watched the movies, my daughter also enjoyed this one. So oldie but goody!!!","1756":"I bought this as a present for my mom because she loves this movie. Very cute.","1757":"Overall my feelings about this purchase? . . . Meh!  It's okay.  Super cheesy and low-budget but I like it.  There's a lot of dead time and it's not necessarily structured like a workout video in terms of doing it real time.  I wouldn't purchase it again.  I would just look up you tube videos for free and then do my own workout.  Oh well.  She is VERY flexible.","1758":"....This is a pretty odd movie.  Taken at face value, you have to wonder at Bette Davis doing it.  Was she really at the point in her career that she would be forced to do nothing movies like this?  Was it a chance to take a big time swipe at the movie star ethos that she felt herself above?  Was it just a chance to take a cheap hot at Joan Crawford, the ultimate movie star, and someone that she loathed?  We'll never know, but we do have this little jem to show for it.","1759":"As a movie, Muppets From Space is good, entertaining, family fun for the young at heart. As a muppet movie, it's definitely low on the list - but far, FAR above anything they've done like \"Kermit's Swamp Years.\" I suffered through that one, while I actually enjoyed MFS. Like many have said it lacks the original muppet songs, but it has a fantastic opening sequence and features a lot of the less common muppets, like Clifford from \"The Jim Henson Hour,\" and many more. If you're a die-hard muppet fan, it's still a must have.","1760":"Although not as good as the classic muppet movies, this movie still is enjoyable.  Brain Henson has taken his father's muppets into the modern day-with space ships, roommates and popular music.  In DVD the quality can't be beat! The story is fun and original and focuses on the ever allusive orgin of our favorite weird muppet, Gonzo.  It's great for a family movie night and has laughs for everyone in the family!","1761":"After seeing my Favorite Airplane! movies it's kind of hard not to ruin the Airport series of movies, and while this movie has been often criticized I liked it, *Spoiler*The Villain Ironically was to become a villain in real life and some say get away with it. (Wagner along with Walken and Natalie Woods, Who Did it?) The effects look compared to now outdated but don't let take away from an otherwise serious and yet good movie.","1762":"Take a hyper-masculine George Kennedy, add a flawlessly coiffed John Davidson, mix in a bit of pot-smoking Jimmie Walker, and finish off with a complete lack of drama or suspense and you have one of the finest guilty  pleasures ever released. While the first two &quot;Airport&quot; films will  always stand as the best, the final entry in the series manages enough  unintentional laughs, groans, and awful attempts at special effects to keep  fans satisfied.","1763":"After seeing my Favorite Airplane! movies it's kind of hard not to ruin the Airport series of movies, and while this movie has been often criticized I liked it, *Spoiler*The Villain Ironically was to become a villain in real life and some say get away with it. (Wagner along with Walken and Natalie Woods, Who Did it?) The effects look compared to now outdated but don't let take away from an otherwise serious and yet good movie.","1764":"Also the most fun; Watch with some one who knows advation and concordes.Both of you will bust a gut laughingout loud. For example : doing a loop-de-loop at mach 2 ? LOL","1765":"Double feature DVD with THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE \/ MESSIAH OF EVIL, also known as DEAD PEOPLE (1973).  DEAD PEOPLE is brilliant. A one-of-a-kind film.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing with THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE (La plus longue nuit du diable (1971)). It's disorienting, awful, and cliched.  Get ready to sleep.","1766":"The movie is just horrible,but the cast of stars in early roles make it most entertaining. It must have been the fault of the people who wrote,directed and produced this movie because most of the people in it had very successful careers ,despite this dreadful film. Sally and Arnold were really cute in this,but they deserved a better script. Very off beat! It is worth checking out(for the curious,like myself),if it is low priced,but I wouldn't invest any large sum of cash for this(and I am glad I didn't) !","1767":"I'm sure this movie was written just to showcase 3 great stars: Jeff Bridges, Sally Field, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It's a story about a guy trying to save his gym from being taken by the bad guys.  Ho hum!  It's a riot to see the biggest of the big (Arnold) standing next to the smallest of the small (Sally Field).  She's so cute!  Nothing much here except 2 great movie stars and early Arnold with packed-on muscles.","1768":"This film is a worthy attempt to capture the ongoing saga of the Stargate SG-1 phenomena, however, it does not reach the height that Stargate Continuum did. It is still worthwhile science fiction and both employs and contains marvelous visual imagery, definately worth the special effects represented.","1769":"This movie is a good fix for a Star Gate junkie like myself. I've enjoyed Stargate SG-1 since very early on.  I didn't find this movie very compelling. The story line was good, but not that good. It was in may ways predictable. It had a few surprises.  The special effects were very good, but the storyline itself wasn't that great to me. I like Continuum much better than this movie. Do I think it is a worthwhile addition to my SG-1 collection - absolutely - they had me at the opening lines!","1770":"I was a bit underwhelmed by this movie, despite my passionate interest in the stargate universe and my appreciation of the ori storyline.  I thought the Ori were a great evolution of the stargate story, but this concluding chapter was a bit of a let-down.  Many other reviewers commented on the various specifics, but basically if you've seen the rest of the Ori saga in seasons 9 & 10 you'll want to see this movie.  It just isn't as good as it could have been.","1771":"This is just an episode of Stargate, SG-1.  It is not a movie by any measure.","1772":"I enjoyed Continuum much more. Maybe because it gives closure to the series. But, if you have enjoyed Stargate SG-1 all these years, you will enjoy this DVD then.","1773":"SPOILERS. This story wraps up the Ori story line much like how they did Goa'uld one, so it isn't that clever, but it is fun and well done. Similar to Continuum and the show in general, the Stargate stories end in the destruction of all of the bad guys. It would be good to see something a bit different. I give it 3 stars because it is worth the money I think, but it could be better or have done more.","1774":"It was nice to have a little more SG-1 to watch, but otherwise this movie is unimpressive. Predictable plot, and out of character behavior by the principles made it a bit Ho-hum.  Borrow it, don't buy it.","1775":"I did enjoy the DVD - but basically this would have been broadcast as a two part TV episode  -maybe three parts if they could figure out how to divide it into three parts.  The production values are simialr to the TV show.  For the next DVD - Continuum I think I would rather rent the DVD.","1776":"didn't do what it says on the tin. It was supposed to answer outstanding questions and add closure to the end of series 10 but does not deliver on its promises","1777":"Stargate will always be a great series...no question about that.  Unfortunately, this DVD misses being more than a hurried attempt at wrapping up some loose ends. So many loose ends that none get fair treatment, and it ruins the story. Locations were great, same quality production values, but just not put together. So sad to say it, but true.","1778":"Had to buy it to see how the Ori story arc ended.  Would have been great as the series finale for Stargate SG-1, but not a stand-alone movie.  Sort of a clever business move to end the series with a cliff-hanger, and then release  the final episode on DVD - but....","1779":"An ok movie, but more like two regular season episodes strung together.  Over priced but I will still purchase the sequel because I loved the show and want to see how the story lines end.","1780":"I love ben browder in farscape far better than I like him in Stargate. I guess I just a Jack O'Neill fan to appreciate his character and the changes in the team.  Overall the movie was good and is worth having if you are a SG-1 fan.","1781":"I was so excited knowing it was on it's way.  I thought it was going to closing the chapter on the Ori but it really only left me with more questions.  Maybe the next one will be more helpful.  If you are a fan like me as long as they keep coming I will keep watching.","1782":"if the writers\/producers weren't so obsessed with Ben Browder.  Since his introduction in season 9 he seems to be front and center most of the time while the characters we have known and loved for years get pushed to the side.  Mitchell was once again the central focus of this show while the other characters, most notably Sam, was pushed into a supporting role.  I won't preorder Continuum.  I want to see it first and if it's another Cam Mitchell fest, I'll won't waste my money.","1783":"Not as well written as the series. Seems the writers were too interested in wrapping things up and rushed through the story line. Certain scenes, though breath taking, where too long and seemed to be edited that way just to kill time.","1784":"I think the writers were trying to milk the show with these last couple movie releases. The series was better but these are still worth a watch. Just do not expect too much and it will all be good.","1785":"I'm disappointed in the direction that the series has taken.  I won't buy another \"Movie\" continuation of Stargate, until it has Movie quality.  This was nothing more than a long episode.  And they also didn't seem to have the same energy as they once did.  Maybe they should just give it up and concentrate on the Atlantis spin off.","1786":"Glad I bought it and my kid and I will certainly watch this again and again but...I have to agree with the issues previously stated. Still, great production values and an entertaining video. I do think they did a credible job of killing off this story line which was a poor substitute for those nasty Goauld. Looking forward to the next one, with Baal and the bad guy (I think) and I hope they make enough cash on these to keep them coming.(If the cast are still into it)","1787":"This dvd is for hard core fans only. Even Ben Browder couldn't make me watch this more than once.","1788":"I have been a Stargate fan since the beginning...I was not totally blown away by \"The Ark of Truth\", maybe it was because the wait was so long and I was so disappointed that the show wasn't renewed the anticipation left me wanting it to be more.  Maybe because there was no \"Ricky D\" the dry witted humor was missing.  Vala did a good job to lighten things but the wittiness of Jack O'Neill was not there and I miss that.  That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!","1789":"I was really excited to get this movie.  It was the ending to the Stargate SG1 story and wanted to see what the would do with it.  I think the movie was good but I was expecting a lot more.  The epic battles were epic to the point and tune of 30 seconds. I would say get this DVD if your a fan of SG1 and want to see how their story ends.  If you don't like the series then this movie isn't for you.","1790":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0010YSD7M\">Stargate - The Ark of Truth<\/a>  Wrapped up things quite nicely.  Acting was on par with the television show.  What else can I say; at this price, buy it.","1791":"Sorry to break up the love fest. I am a Stargate Fan and was pumped about this dvd release. Unfortunately, The Ark of Truth is just so-so.  Don't worry no spoilers in this review. The movie will give you a temporary \"SG-1 fix\". I'm not sure that it's worth buying the dvd though. The writing was average. Same story different show... find the artifact, figure out the ancient magic, defeat the enemy after a superhuman effort, save the day. The special effects were pretty good. The absence of Richard Dean Anderson has really hurt Stargate in general.","1792":"OK film. First time viewed. Don't need to see it again. More my wife's thing...","1793":"I was expecting a bit more for the conclusion of the Ori story arc. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the ending. They seemed to wrap it up too quickly. The beginning of the movie built the story up and then they pull out something that has been beaten to death in other seasons.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, however I was disappointed with the conclusion. I own all 10 seasons of SG-1 and the first 3 seasons of Atlantis on DVD, but somehow I think Ark of Truth could have been better.","1794":"This movie is good if you're a Stargate Fan.  Since we don't have the opportunity to see it on TV anymore - it will seem really good to fans. Not too much substance to the movie - mainly just going thru the motions - but it was good to see all the characters again.","1795":"Like most Stargate crap I could have written better if they just gave me a general plot line to follow.  Despite the poor writing and lack of engrossing plot twists, it was a predictable yet good movie.  Stargate usually delivers that average quality that gets a viewer to come back for 10 years strait.  Good job overall.","1796":"I've just begun to explore the Euro-horror genre, with Lips of Blood being one of the best so far. Interesting visuals (including attractive semi-nude female vampires), effectively somber mood and pacing, and a strong element  of mystery, all serve to make this Rollin film worth seeing. However, if  you are really into lots of gore and sex in horror films, this is one to  skip.","1797":"I thought that I would see the amazing views of any countries, But the views were not good quality enough.","1798":"Really beautiful stuff on the surface but needs more substance, not just lovely scenes.  Good to sample picture quality of TVs.","1799":"this kotr has to be the worst kotr yet ..i think personally wwe is trying to make brock the next goldberg but is failing ..brocks too green to be where hes at right now all in all its alright","1800":"This is an adult movie, for adult audiences. A love affair between two strangers. A misunderstanding and a memory of what it could have been.  I longed for this DVD and just received it from Amazon last week.  But to my disappointment is was a CENSORED version, for the american audiences: Ten minutes were cut from the original european version! All the sexually explicit scenes were banned (true: the movie still keeps it's atmosphere).  I never tought I was ordering a 'clean movies' version.  I'd rather have ordered it from Amazon.fr (integral full-version, with english subtitles)  :-(","1801":"As soon as the DVD was available it was shipped and arrived in great shape. The Blue-ray version of this classic is clearly a better picture, but I was sorely disappointed in the FULL screen format. My older version, even though not blue-ray is a better field of view, pan-scan I think, but closer to widescreen. I must have missed the Screen size on my per-order of this movie.","1802":"Third installment of the character. Not as good as the first, but still enjoyable.","1803":"Great movie, very enjoyable.  Love the Corwall setting and the eclectic characters.  Can't beat Craig and Brenda together.","1804":"This is about a woman who loses her husband and finds herself broke.  She and the gardener find a way to make lots of money, even though it is illegal.  Very funny in some parts and has a great ending.","1805":"Dancer in the Dark as a stupid plot that is self-indulgent in a juvenile way, but the movie is worth watching solely for the performance of Bjork as Selma. What a pity she is not making any more movies!","1806":"I rented this movie at the library based on reviews posted here. I have to say.....you have to REALLY like Bjork's music to entirely enjoy the film. I found her acting to be incredible, and the story had me riveted, but the musical numbers? Just couldn't get through them. I actually fast-forwarded after the first two. They were just too bizarre for me. Everything else about this film was amazing and I would still recommend seeing it, just be prepared for ALOT of musical numbers in Bjork's style of singing.","1807":"The pacing at the start of this anime is fantastic.  The story is interesting.  I'd give the first half of this anime five stars.  Then things just start to get dumb.  It really should have ended with the showdown between the two main antagonists in the first half of the series.","1808":"Did anyone else find it extremely ironic that a huge picture of Near graces the top of the packaging for the Mello figurine? It's easily 3 times as large as poor Mello. Given the relationship between Near and Mello in the series, I can only assume that the manufacturers were feeling particularly sadistic that day.  Perhaps, in the spirit of things, we should have Light's giant face featured on the packaging for L's figurine.","1809":"DEATHNOTE WAS GREAT UNTIL L DIED. THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE ENDED WITH LIGHT WINNING. AT LEAST THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT THE CRAP DUO THAT IS MELLOW AND NEAR.","1810":"Not a bad film, but a direct ripoff of Man on Fire, with kung fu fighting and sappy music thrown in.","1811":"This comes from one of the writers of 'The Sopranos,' and it shows. There are real quality lines & a lot of things we've seen before. The performances lift it a little, though, as they are the strongest thing here.  Alec Baldwin follows his great turn in 'The Departed' with another strong turn. This is pretty good entertainment, nothing great.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1906669023\">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys<\/a>","1812":"This is an excellent movie full of twists and thrills.  But the edition being published now has many scenes missing from the original movie.  I was very disappointed they were not included in this version.  Still, this edition did not omit the scenes that included a lot of the art giving the movie deeper meaning than its appearance.","1813":"Can someone please explain to me why the movie released overseas was 35 minutes longer and contained the movie scenes that would have actually allowed the screen version to make as much sense as the book?  I was so lucky to have seen the extended version, but was quite angry and frustrated to find that I cannot purchase it anywhere in the USA or on a disc that can actually be played on a DVD player from the United States.  And people actually think we have freedom here in America.  You are only kidding yourselves if you believe that.","1814":"This movie was pretty disappointing seeing it was directed by Ron Howard and starred Tom Hanks. It just didn't really get going. I have read the book and it was much better, sometimes good books don't necessarily translate into great movies. I am a great fan of Ron Howard, Appollo 13 and Missing were spectacular.","1815":"Good acting but the screenplay was shot. Too many things were changed for my liking. Editing was also a little rough at times. A C+ film","1816":"It's readily agreed that director Ron Howard's uneven adaptation of the Dan Brown best-seller will not win any major awards. When considering the expository nature of the source material, it's amazing that \"The Da Vinci Code\" came off as well as it did. Though overlong and rather talky in spots, Howard has crafted a diverting mystery-thriller that benefits immeasurably from Sir Ian McKellan's bravura performance. Audrey Tautou is the ideal Sophie, but Tom Hanks cannot overcome his miscasting as Professor Robert Langdon. Still, it's a brave attempt.","1817":"Each time I play this movie on my dvd player I tell my self I will finish it all the way threw. I never do. It is an interesting movie. I like the story, but can't finish it all the way threw. I always find something else to do or fall asleep.","1818":"Some people aren't going to like this, but I did. I found it interesting and well-paced enough to enjoy. It has some differences from the book (some major, other minor) but overall it's still a good movie. But you definitely want to read the book as well!","1819":"I read the book and devoured each chapter.  For me the movie was so - so.  Tom Hanks did a fine job, but the book....  So much better.  It was nice to see all of the different locations that made the story so controversial.","1820":"Not unlike many film productions based on a literary piece, we would not rate it as good as the book.","1821":"The DVC has the problem of creating its own paradox. If you have not read the book, there will be things that you won't understand. If you have read the book, the movie, like many movies, will not contain the true meat of details though it does supply a nice desert at a somewhat slow rate.","1822":"Suggest to watch this without any interruptions.  Very complex movie.  I've been told that it is better understood if you read the book previous to viewing the film.","1823":"The movie was okay, I think a prerequisite is to read Dan Brown's book in order to know who these characters are.","1824":"Having read all Dan Browns books I had high hopes for this movie. Maybe if I hadn't read the books first it would have been a better experience. Overall a pleasant movie and worth watching but I felt that Tom Hanks was a little bland in the part.","1825":"I think Leonardo Da Caprio would have done a better job as Tom Hanks in this film...plus there is the whole thing where both he and Da Vinci have the same first and middle name.","1826":"you'd find better value by buying the single disk version, i found very little extra value in the second disk.","1827":"Wait for it on video. Not worth going to see on the big screen and spending the cash. We checked our watches several times. It was like eating a bland meal - we kept waiting for the flavor and seasoning, but never got it.","1828":"I know what the premise of the movie is. However, I've never read the book and I've never seen the movie in the theater. Based solely on the DVD, I don't think the movie is \"all that\". I expected more and was disappointed.","1829":"\"The Da Vinci Code\" is similar to \"National Treasure\" but it is slower paced and less exciting. Still, it has an interesting story and it's fairly well made. I think it would be better if it were much shorter. Also, it has numerous picturesque settings, such as Paris, but the cinematography does not bring out the best of these locations. The Blu-ray transfer is okay but disappointingly flat and fuzzy for hi-def. There was only one scene that looked really sharp and textured to me. Reviewed 4\/30\/2009 after watching on Blu-ray.","1830":"I got this as a gift and it's not worth the extra money.  The movie is good, but the cryptex is only cool a short time.","1831":"A reasonably good film adaptation of a complex novel. Probably hard to translate to film, and verbose in parts, but overall, keeps you entertained.","1832":"THE MOVIE WAS RATHER CONFUSING, LENGTHY, AND FILMED TOO MUCH IN THE DARK.  IT LACKED SUBSTANCE. THROUGH IT ALL I ABSOLUTELY LOVED TOM HANKS PERFORMANCE.","1833":"This movie was very well made, beautifully filmed, well acted, etc.  The story was juvenile.  Possibly infantile.  As an example - Tom Hanks plays a cryptologist.  Cryptology is a deep and fascinating subject, and the story could have explored that topic in interesting ways.  Instead, when Tom Hanks encounters a message written on a floor, he exclaims (in amazement) \"It's an anagram!\".  Oh come on, an ANAGRAM?  Any 8-year-old child can handle that.  Who needs a cryptologist?","1834":"I gotta tell you, if Dan Brown was a director, this movie would be the culmination of his novel.  There are things that play out better in the book, but there are visuals that look better in the movie.  If you are worried about it straying too far from the book, don't be.  That can be a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing.  Worth a look if you've read it and if you haven't, well, it's your call.","1835":"It is not a masterpiece like Ron Howard,s (COCOON and APOLLO13) or a piece of art and perfection like Da Vinci,s(THE MONALISA and MADDONA OF THE ROCKS).It,s just another summer hit(you can compare it to NATIONAL TREASURE) thanks to Dan Brown,s highly acclaimed and well knoun novel(masterpiece).This movie was very very faithful to the book and to the charecters on it.It is Filled with great puzzel (code) solvings and eye popping locations.Mackellen and specially Bettany done great and gave their charecters the right treatment.Read the book and then watch this one like myself to live this  entertaining experience (ride).","1836":"This wasn't a horrible movie, but there was something missing. Most people had read the book, so it was from the beginning a difficult challenge for the movie to do more than the book. I don't think it did. At least the soundtrack is awesome. (Hans Zimmer-highly recommended).","1837":"I gave the movie 3 stars. I could have given it 5 stars, but Tom Hanks was the wrong guy there. I could understand Ron Howard's respect for Tom Hanks, but he could have noticed the expression on Hanks' face while seated and listening to Teabing explain things to Sophie. He got that Forrest Gump look on his face! Tom Hanks playing a professor? NO!!! It could have been Johnny Depp or a much younger guy.","1838":"I've not read the book but, my wife has and seduced by all the hype, we rented and viewed this disappointing movie.  This had the potential to be a heart-pounding, intellectually exciting movie but, it was not exciting and I found it just average.  According to my wife, large chunks of the book were just not presented.  Tom Hanks looked like he was sleepwalking through his monochromatic performance; just there to pick up his big paycheck at the end.  I sure hope the book was better than this.","1839":"I spent the whole movie comparing it to the book.  I still feel that you need to have a Catholic background to get this story.  My husband and 17 year old daughter were pretty lost.","1840":"I have not had the time to watch the movie in full yet but so far so good!","1841":"Purchased this DVD for my niece's mate and I think he watched it once. Not a very thrilling movie. Loved the hype, but movie is a yawn.","1842":"I know blu ray is the future but dvd still outsells it big time.  I've been waiting since the original release for the extended cut of Da Vinci Code.  PLEASE don't tell me you're only releasing it on blu ray.  You are in the business of making money, aren't you?","1843":"I must say... It does buy its premises from numerous other sources, including such films as Stigmata 1999 and Eye Of the Devil 1967.  There really isn`t much new here and the surprises are few, I even got the point before the professor...  Still it`s watchable because of the performances, excellent production values and that it was made at a time when being religious has sadly become a neglected, surpressed, riduculed and even boycotted issue in the western world.","1844":"Harmless fun, comparable to a Saturday morning episode of Scooby Doo!","1845":"I didn't see it, it was for a friend. But I heard it was good.","1846":"Sometimes you are constrained by your material. Howard, the master storyteller, does his best, but the thing is a bore.","1847":"If the shown info is correct, this is not the complete set as issued in England.  The England set has 6 discs and runs 17 hours, whereas this US one is 5 discs and runs only about 13 1\/2 hours.  I don't know why this is so, but an addition $20 would have made the US set worthwhile.  Who wants an incomplete set?","1848":"These are interesting for a fan of Helen Mirren.  The works show her in early roles, so are interesting to compare to her more recent roles.  They are not the most interesting of works themselves.  I'd recommend her later roles over these if a person is limited in the number to purchase.","1849":"An entertaining giallo,this suffers a little from the large debt owed to Argento`s masterpiece.The romance between the engaging leads,the Goblinesque music,etc.I personally prefer Bido`s The Bloodstained Shadow(Giallo Collection),but this is by no means a dud.Leisurely paced,those willing to sit back and soak up the atmosphere will be rewarded.There are also some rather violent deaths in the film,including my favorite,set to classical music!Fans of 70`s gialli will want to add this to their collection.","1850":"This is an overlooked rarely seen little gem. Typical 50's fare western, however, it contains a huge cast of some of the best known character actors of the era. This fact alone makes this film worth watching. Payne is more than adequate and although appearing tired and a little weather beaten, Duryea still has shining moments of his brilliant old snarly self from his heydays. Harry (Dobe) Carey Jr. plays a bad guy in this one but you still can't help but like him......","1851":"Strictly for Yvonne de Carlo-Fans. It's a B-Pictures with a likeable cast. I used to like it better when I used to go to the movies. We both have grown a little bit older. Stangely Yvonne de Carlo hasn't. At least in this movie.","1852":"Thought provoking and not for those easily depressed. It has a ring of truth to it as I have actually met men and women who are aggressive in the way they speak and manipulative in their actions such as the main characters in this film, regardless of their marital status, etc.  So no matter how emotionally brutal this film may appear, it has a ring of truth.","1853":"This is a movie about obsessed ploeasure seekers which a found to be tedious and boring.  Clive Owens gave a great pewrformance on a character I completly disliked.  No one was likeable and I thought Julia Roberts was miscast.","1854":"I found this movie to be quite unique. Serial infidelity and deception take course as two of the main characters feed onto their lust for one another without giving the ones they truly love a second thought.  Although the movie drags on a bit, it has an important message: true love shouldn't be taken for granted.","1855":"The story is good, the cast is great but the movie seems to lose focus a couple of times as if the director did not know how to move to the next step...  overall a good movie to watch","1856":"Not since Little Black Book has there been a movie where I dont like any character. Closer is a strong movie, will harsh, sexual words, and great performances from everyone. There is a little bit of  confusion, but it's hard to completly like a movie when there's no characters you can relate to.","1857":"In my world people are not acting like this?  Or are they?  Selfish, selfish, self gratifying, live for the moment sad people portrayed in this film.  Clive Owen gives a powerful performance.  He is gorgeous but nasty.  Jude Law's character is sexy but pitiful.  Nice to see Julia Roberts in a role with some meat to it.  Beware if the use of the F word turns you off as it is tossed around here every few seconds.","1858":"Plenty of reviews of the movie already, so either you like it or you didn't.  I couldn't really see any reason to have bought this in Blu-Ray.  There were no alternate endings or anything, it's just a drama, so the graphic impact of the upgraded player are minimal....  This seems like a waste of money when a regular DVD would have done just as well.","1859":"Does anyone know the name of the song or artist who sings the song in the opening credits of Closer?","1860":"How much did Julia Roberts get to use such filth? I went with my mom and my sister and well i have to say i was enbarassed to say the least a lot of the conversation did not fit the scenero, and I felt it was a waste of a good actor Clive Owen, and I think Jude Law who i think is a great actor was miscast. The real \"movie star\" here no doubt Natalie Portman. I would rent it before actually purchasing it.","1861":"A film about annoying, selfish and jealous people. Just like real life, accept more articulate. The film jumps months and years ahead  seamlessly, so the veiwer can feel clever for followng the story. A film for people who think they are sophisticated.","1862":"Esta pelicula del diantres:-p  Bueno, la peli me dejo esperando otra cosa,  Y me tenia haciendo bolas en el sofa;  Siempre era un drama, un lio, etc.  Quizas no pudo ser peor.  Quizas fue mi gusto.","1863":"Where the hell is Natalie Portman's full-frontal nudity? Is there an unrated version?","1864":"actually i waited very long time to watch this film  but i must say that i m disappointed  i don t know why,but i thought this film is like \"Notting Hill\"  but the film is far from that  on the other hand,the actors are fine.and it was fun to watch","1865":"This is a great mix of science fiction and action.  Time travel is one of the big questions and this film gives an entertaining scenario without pretending to give an answer to the currently unanswerable.","1866":"When this movie came out I Wanted to see it but never made it. THEN I went to rent it & couldn't find it for YEARS! Now that I FINALLY saw it.... Well it wasn't as cool as I remember thinking it would be as a kid.  But it IS an interesting story line & plot.","1867":"We'd looked for this for a while and enjoyed it.  It's mid-career Kirk Douglas and we enjoyed the plot.  :)","1868":"Je cherche a copier ou acheter ce film en version fran\u00e7ais,(Nimitz retour vers l'enfer) communiquer moi si cela est possible sergus2000@hotmail.com","1869":"Interesting concept on WWII and present day thinking.  Worth having on your collector's list.","1870":"That on famouse day on 7 December 1941 in Pearl Harbour; Would't we all want to change it. This Movie plays very well with this wish. Good movie with a good explanation to various occurances in those two day of December 1941. The oonly contraversion is the existint of The Flight Commander twice on the same day, 6 Dec. 1981 (As the Flight Commander on Deck of the Nimitz and the Rich Industrialist coming to see the departure of the Nimits on her voyage. An impossibility yet very good presented.","1871":"The Crucible is an intresting movie on the Salem Witchcraft Trials. Arthur Miller had the biggest decisions on what to put in the movie from the play. He then decided to make some of the scenes different. During the Salem Witchcraft Trials in the 1600s many women were accused of doing witchcraft. Abigail Williams was one of the main one accusing others in that era. Elizabeth Proctor was onr main woman that was accused in the witchcraft trials. Many people were hung because they didn't say that they weren't witches.","1872":"i thought that it was a alright movie. there was a bunch of hipucripes in the movie and a lot of people dided in the movie. i thought that the end of the movie was the good part because right before thay hung john he was saying a prayer. but before he finished the prayer thay kicked the bord out from under him and thay did not give him time to say amen which means so be it, also closeing. but i thought the movie was a alright movie.","1873":"The movie showed a good example of what went on in that day in age.  People do not hang each in public.","1874":"I would buy a used Dvd copy of this movie from like BlockBuster 3 for $20 sale. But get the unrated version. Not as bad as people are saying.","1875":"This movie puts you in a \"i know what you did last summer setting\". It's thrilling, but the deranged killer kills his victims so old-fashioned. I mean \"gutting people with a knife\" really?? All this killing because he had a obsession with one of his students. I only only gave three stars because it had a \"don't watch in the dark\" feeling.","1876":"this movie was pretty good.. but they could've done a lot better with the script.. i was expecting it to be a movie i could cuddle up on the couch with my fianc&eacute;e and watch but, it just wasn't that scary","1877":"While this movie has the same formula as movies I seen in the past. Somehow Martin Lawrence sells this movie. He plays a Loudmouth coach who's kick off the team. Must get his act together to get his old job back. While the team He's forced to coach a team that couldn't catch a cold. But under his expertise he refines them.It has plenty a laughs and Wendy Raquel Robinson is great in this movie. Don't let the critics sway you! Go see for yourself.","1878":"When hot shot college basketball coach Roy McCormick has a meltdown on the court, he's bannished to coach a group of underachievers at his former junior high school.  This was a surprizing funny film that isn't full of foul language or tasteless humor.  Martin Lawrence shows he can give laughs without being vulgar.  Good entertainment for the whole family!","1879":"This movie is a typical old school for of vampire tale.  Where the characters involved don't know how is the vampire, but, we the viewer know immediately.  Lovely women, a vampire out for some blood, bad translation.  But, its a relic and that's why I love it....","1880":"not alot of films hold my attention but this one had alot of things going on&unfolding that I wanted to watch it all the way through. very dramatic&so much tension that you were wodering what was gonna happen next.","1881":"pretty good.  ending not clear to me, but still wasn't a bad little study in love\/drugs and what we think is happiness.","1882":"This is good early Chan stuff. The acting is alittle slow, and sometimes typical of most kung fu flicks,but the wooden men scene and the last fight seen make Chan really stand out. I think that it is worth watching once and could be fun to watch with friends on a boring weekend.","1883":"Yes its Just OK. I didn't think this was a sbad as the other reviews. But atleast the video quality is good. If you are thinking about buying the ULTRAMAN vol.1 from BCI. Dont buy it. It sucks. Buy Tetsugin 28 the movie instead.","1884":"Gigantor as us americans know him stars in his own feature film.A japanese creation known as Tetsujin 28 this film brings me back to the days when the trans-lux cartoon played on UHF stations and I would bearly get reception.It's a cool flick and the cg work holds up,I only wish there was more robot battles.The Black Ox an evil robot is Tetsujin's nemises who appeared in the cartoon series.Worth a peek especially if your a fan of the Gigantor series.The dvd is in japanese with english subtitles.","1885":"This is the story of Brent and Mike, two high funcioning zombies. They meet after death and set out on a journy to find a lost love. Highly entertaining movie, yes very corny aswell, the on screen chemistry between the two leads is great and charasmatic enough to hold your attention. If your a little tired of the same old zombie formular give this one a go, its a refreshing new twist on the zombie genre, don't take it too serious and you will enjoy this zombie buddy film A must watch for all die hard zombie fans","1886":"Nothing really to write home about... so to speak. It was okay and it did have its moments. Definitely there was a story line there. For funny though... not so much.","1887":"Like others have stated, this DVD is missing eight seconds from the original broadcast.  Not just any eight seconds, but a crucial eight seconds with just 0:38 remaining in the game.  I have contacted NCAA On-Demand about the issue and they replied that \"We checked with our labs who have the master tape on hand, and that footage is missing from the master tape for whatever reason....we will not be issuing a \"corrected\" version of this game.\"","1888":"friends rob banks and are wanted outlaws, Timothy Dalton wants them dead and kills their families, including Kathy Bates. great action and shootouts, the end where Farrell swings on the side of the train and shoots threw the windows is the best action scene. othewise its a bore for the most part. Ali Larter has never been more sexier, when shes in the water with Farrell and then the 2 are surrounded by horses on shore.","1889":"I've watched western ever since I was a little girl. This one is one of the better ones that I have seen. I'm not real big on rating the looks of actors and\/or actresses, but the the characters where excellent in the movie. The history of Jesse, Frank, and Jim were accurate. This is a movie that I would recommend to those who like westerns and like a little laugh.","1890":"At the start of the film, I would have given it five stars.  It told a story I'd never heard before and it gave background information about &quot;Isabella.&quot;  The movie was funny and had a certain fairy tale nature.  There's only one problem with this tale.  There's no Prince Charming.  I didn't want &quot;Isabella&quot; to end up with either of these selfish men.  It's really frustrating to watch her work really hard to get over a man only to return to him in the end.","1891":"A Cute Movie full of Love and Magic~ I'm not a Penelope Cruz Fan at all.  My Heart lays with Nicole Kidman~ However this movie is &quot;Fun, Clean, and full of Magic and Love ~~The soundtrack is really a must have.","1892":"I must admit I started watching this one with a sense of doubt and I prayed it wouldn't be another trivial gay comedy. But, hey, this one is quite o.k. The plot is acceptable, the acting doesn't hurt the viewers (with exception for JOnathan Silverman, which is kinda boring as jealous and lousy bro) If you have chance, rent it.","1893":"I admit that this movie was good but it is no &quot;Hard Days Night&quot;. Spice Girls tried to copy many things that were in HDN, for example, lateness for a concert. They made it seem as if they were trying to do the same thing that the Beatles did over thirty years earlier.","1894":"Spice World is actually a very hilarious film. It makes fun of the Spice Girls and the world they live in. It's also done in the spirit of A Hard Day's Night. Everyone in the film is great, and it's a nice surprise to see  some notable Brits like Elton John and Jennifer Saunders in the film. Don't  take the movie seriously, it's meant to be fun and silly. Also, this is one  of the rare momments you will see Geri Halliwell with the group. It is  definately a guilty pleasure, and fun to watch!","1895":"Well, I remember this being my favorite show when I was 11 or 12. Couldn't believe they have this movie on DVD so I had to buy it.  It's pretty much a joke of a movie but because I still have some love for the Spice Girls I was glad I'm able to have this for my collection.  It's one of those movies that you get a bunch of your girlfriends together and remember the hype of the Spice Girl era and have a pretty good laugh.","1896":"It's amusing that the Beatles first film, \"A Hard Day's Night,\" keeps cropping up when \"Spiceworld\" is compared to another movie.  Sure, both movies feature pop groups, but how the Spice Girls could ever be compared to the Beatles is beyond my grasp.  I doubt there will be a 40th anniversary celebration for \"Spiceworld\" in 2037, but who knows?  I once saw an old Herman's Hermits movie from way back in the 1960's called, \"Hold On,\" which may actually be closer in spirit to \"Spiceworld.\"","1897":"I've done yoga workouts in the past. This one is definitely targeted towards the women crowd. Some of the exercises are a bit awkward for men to do. Not a big fan of this DVD. The matrix function is good though because you can pick which parts of the workout you want to do.","1898":"As I said in the other review I like their older DVDs better.  as I noticed in the new ones from last year. Still like the older ones better.","1899":"Not a huge Capra fan, too preachy (except for 'It Happened One Night'. Hilarious, with no moral). It's an OK movie. I watched it due to a friend's recommendation. The wakcy characters really aren't that wacky, and as it goes along you wonder how do these people survive from day to day? Grandpa (Lionel Barrymore) says he evaluates stamp collections, but does philately really pay that much? As for the ending, Capra used it again, along with a lot of the cast, 8 years later in IAWL.","1900":"Fourteen year old Thomas (Raphael Sbarge) is brutally abused by his parents but manages to find comfort in associating with a gay film director who is making a documentary on physical child abuse. As the relationship deepens, the two falling in love, the elder is forced to make a decision: runaway with Thomas or focus on his career and let the boy possibly be beaten to death. This somewhat B-ish film suffers from mediocre acting but is certainly original and daring.","1901":"This is an updated and borrowed version of Richard Gere and Louis Gosset Jr's \"An Officer and a Gentleman\". This time its about a young welder who finally gets into the US Naval Academy Annapolis and faces off against his commanding officer Cole. Its a hard year and full of the ocassional romance with the requisite female. Annapolis is not bad and has an attractive cast but most fans of this film will be military fans who just love the genre.","1902":"This movie is what many may call the sterotypical military story, however I think that it fell short of even that. Every good military movie has the basics; drive, determination, defeat, and honor. Annapolis however fell short of them all.  I so badly wanted this movie to get better but the main reason why this movie wasnt good becasue it lacked a good plot! No type of storyline, just the hustle and muscle it takes to make it when people have told you you couldnt. Yeah Yeah thats all good but Annapolis left me unmotivated and definitly bored.","1903":"This movie is a remake attempt of the 1980's Richard Gere \"An Officer and a Gentleman\"  with a dash of \"Rocky\".  It was predictable and, at times, sappy.  My wife liked the pretty faces and the uniforms though.  All in all, I still give it 3 stars because it still has some good acting and a few goos scenes. The story was too predictable and it really is a wannbe \"Officer and a Gentleman\" but doesn't quite make it. My wife liked it a lot (we are both military people too).","1904":"the DVD was received all scratched up,  Tried to clean it up but didn't help.  Was able to see the movie OK.","1905":"This movie had strong acting (with great actors and actresses), the plot could have been more interesting, and the ending was sub-par. This movie is worth watching, but not paying $20.00 for a DVD.","1906":"Thankfully I rented this moving before I bought it.  While it was somewhat entertaining it is one movie whose rewatchability is almost zero.  The ending was unfulfilling and the last boxing match should have been done differently.  If you must have it, wait for a couple months and it will be under $10 in no time...","1907":"AFTER VIEWING ALMOST GROWN ITS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THIS DVD IS FOR YOUNG TEEN GIRLS WHO ARE A FAN OF LIL JJ.  THIS DVD GIVES U A LOOK AT LIL JJ AS A RAPPER, ACTOR , PRODUCER, DANCER AND U ALSO GET TO SEE HIS STAND UP COMEDY ACT.  HE ALSO BRINGS SOME OF HIS TEEN FRIENDS ALONG TO PROFORM ALSO.  IT FEATURES A SHOW HE PUT ON IN ATLANTA GA.  ITS A CUTE DVD THAT I WOULD RECOMMENED TO TEENS WHO LIKE LIL JJ.  BUT ALSO NO ITS NOTHING LIKE THE LIL JJ SITCOM \"JUST JORDAN\".","1908":"Wasn't a great movie, in my opinion. Robert De Niro does a good job, as does Paul Dano, but I found this to be a severely depressing film and in the end I felt it wasn't one I would pick again.","1909":"This alternately sweet and profane film shows fewer signs of aging than many of the other time-locked releases of the era, thanks to writer\/director David Beaird's theatrical background. Sadly, the controversy surrounding the producer's reporting of box office grosses had a direct impact on how well the film ultimately performed. A number of reviewers mention the film's soundtrack. If you can figure out how to get in touch with me (make me an Amazon friend), I can steer you in the right direction.","1910":"The movie overall is OK.  It has several scenes where the dialogue is WAY overdone I think.  It also has quite a bit of obscene language and several graphic nudity segments.  I would definitely NOT recommend this be viewed by children.  However, aside from the above observations, it is worth watching.  Deborah Foreman is hilarious at times and makes the whole film.","1911":"this movie was ok for one thing its not very long if you want to buy it well hopefully you will like it better","1912":"I found this movie a bit confusing at times...maybe the way it jumps to and from when he listens to the tapes...but knowing that it was set in a REAL once upon a time actual Asylum makes this movie all the more scary.","1913":"Based on the glowing reviews here at Amazon, I was expecting much more from this psychological horror film.  Ultimately I felt that the pieces of the story don't quite fit together.  Nevertheless the film does offer one compelling reason to view it: the behind-the-scenes look at the now demolished Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, home of the notorious prefrontal lobotomy and quite a remarkable piece of architecture.  Those interested in mental health, history, and architecture may find this location alone worthy of attention.  Those seeking a superior psychological thriller, however, can find much better examples than this film.","1914":"I was reading about this film in the magazine from last year's &quot;Fantasia&quot; film festival in Montreal and it sounded intriguing.  Much to my dismay this film turned out to be an unoriginal entry into the suspense\/horror\/thriller genre.  The story is well written and the camera work\/set design are pretty cool.  I just found there were some loose ends, some areas of the film that should have been dealt with in more detail.  This film could have been incredible but it ended up being so so.","1915":"This looks and sounds great, right up until before \"Number of the Beast,\" the first encore. Has anyone else noticed the 2-second (or 3-second delay) between audio and video that starts when the band begins \"Number of the Beast\"? The visuals are a good two or three seconds behind the audio. Has anyone else's copy done this?","1916":"I loved the movie when I rented it. So I waited for the DVD Delux edition for the soundtrack.  The last song, by Jeremy Sweets - 'Never give up' is not on the soundtrack, the only song i really wanted off of it. The soundtrack is nothing more than all the instrumentals from the movie.  I would've just bought the regular movie for half the price had I been able to preview the cd soundtrack.","1917":"I bought this movie last year on April Fool's day, because I had never seen it before, but I knew how it would end, because of it's title. Some friends are celebrating Spring Break by staying at Muffy St. John's mansion for the weekend. Throughout the movie, the friends die in grotesque ways, but it's all in good fun because it's APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!","1918":"This movie always intirgued me as a kid.  The cover of the girl with her hair braided into a noose?  Good stuff!  I finally got around to watching it as an adult, and it was well worth the wait!  \"April Fool's Day\" is a fun movie!  If you don't like horror movies, don't worry, the gore is pretty much non-existent. The characters are typical 80's type college kids.  The conclusion was fun and refreshing. Very campy, spoofy type of movie, so if you're in that kind of mood, give it a try.","1919":"The story wasn't very interesting, the characters were not very likeable, the gore was not very exciting or well done. There were a couple good scares and the girl was fairly creepy, otherwise, I would have given this film two stars only. If you grew up watching this movie, I can see why you might like it, but short of that, I found this movie pretty pointless.","1920":"It was delivered a lot faster than they first stated.....so that was good. The quality of the DVD was OK.....colour could have been better and volume seemed to fluctuate throughout the movie......but it is still a nice,fun, family movie.","1921":"This movie is good starts out great , and kind of fizzles. But all in all if you like wherwolves this is great movie. I love Ginger Snaps Unleashed better. Its more modern of course. But i also love the olden days. But its not the greates movies. Actually lately i dont know what is .?Lol.","1922":"This looked interesting enough for me to rent, and it started off really well. However, it started to unravel into a campy flick with some bad acting and writing. The ending especially disappointed me, which was sad because this film honestly did start out with real promise (and remained so till about halfway through) I hate it when movies start out great and go downhill. Feh.","1923":"THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY WEREWOLF MOVIE I'VE WATCHED.  TOTALLY WEIRD AND DARK.  GINGER'S REALLY CUTE.  AFTER BEING BITTEN BY A BALLED WEREWOLF LIKE CREATURE, THE GIRL TURNS HOT AND BLOOD CRAZY HUNGRY.  AS CARRIE'S MOTHER SAID, \"FIRST THE BLOOD, THEN THE BOYS\".  GINGER SNAPS IS WORTH ANY HORROR COLLECTERS DREAM. THERE YOU HAVE IT SHORT AND SWEET!","1924":"I nearly purchased this U.S. no-frills, full-screen version of the \"Ginger Snaps\" DVD, but a friend turned me on to a Canadian version (also Region 1) that shows the feature in widescreen and also has DVD extras. (The Canadian version sports a different package design.)<p>I realize that not everybody is into having letterboxed versions and this may not be a movie that you need extras, so the above cautionary note may not apply to you. In that case, the U.S. version should be okay for you.","1925":"Who doesn't letterbox these days?  American distributors that have no clue what their audience wants, that's who.<p>Probably the best horror movie I've seen since... can't remember a better one.  The acting is better than expected, and it delightfully breaks away from the Scream mold.  <p>If you are internet savvy though, pick up the Canadian version of this disc.","1926":"But was not as good as \"Ginger Snaps Back - The Beginning.\"  Still worth watching.","1927":"I bought this movie because everyone was telling me how awesome it was. Once I saw the ending credits, I was a bit disappointed. Yes, it's good. But, it's not great.  We are given some great blood and gore but no spectacular pay off when the wolf finally appears. It looks like a giant, hairless rat.  And werewolves don't explode like ripe watermelons when hit by a car. They would, I feel- get very angry. \"Cursed\" anyone?  While \"Ginger Snaps\" is a good horror film, but it's a bit overrated.","1928":"This movie was quite original in its way but it was really disgusting. I don't think they needed to have people practically being ripped inside out, same with the dogs. But it was a bit funny and entertaining, I'd recommend it.","1929":"This movie started off being intriguing, two sisters making a pact, protecting each other, the domineering mother and THEN it turned into a comedy.  What was so funny was I think the director was being serious.  The last part is the funniest when she changes into the vampire.  This movie had me in tears, I will definatly watch it again for humor sake.","1930":"i have only seen Emily Perkins in &quot;It&quot; so thats one of the reasons i got this dvd out. it was a really good movie. it's about 2 sisters..well im 14. can't explain it as well as other ppl i guess but yeah just watch it u might like it if u like...unusual movies. this is kind of unusual. but really good aswell.","1931":"This DVD was very shaky but when I worked with it it started to work alright. The movie itself was OK. Not exactly what I had expected but as far as a vampire movie it was a B","1932":"Ginger Snaps was a pleasant surprise.  I actually saw Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning before I saw this one.  I enjoyed Ginger Snaps Back so much that I was enticed to watch this one. Now all I need to see is Ginger Snaps 2.  If it is anything like the other two, then I'll be satisfied.  These movies did not get a lot of hype.  Not that I know of anyway.  But they deliver.  Good movie. Watch it and enjoy.","1933":"A honest-to-Cronenberg horror movie that treats lycantropy as a degenerative disease and not a &quot;kewl curse&quot;.  This edition is horrible, however, so it's better if you hop on to Amazon.ca for the Canadian collector's edition (which is widescreen and has extra features other than the trailer).","1934":"I  thought  this  movie  was  good  nothing  wonderful...over looked  and  underrated  YES ....I  see  alot  of  movies  like  this  at  the  video store with  similar  cover box  art  and I never  bother  with  them cuz  usually  their  terrible  after  seeing  these  reviews  I  got  really  curious  and  rented  it..Suprisingly  the  acting  was  good  and  theres  a lot of  violence &amp; gore...If  your  into werewolves  I  definately  recommend....Not scary  but  it's  cool  like  in  a &quot;Lost Boys&quot;  way  if  that  makes  any  sense  to  anyone  hehe !","1935":"This film felt far too much like a fictional war scenario because of the theatrics.  This doesn't make it a bad film.  If you are looking for a documentary, watch \"Restrepo.\"","1936":"The Lost Episodes Great TV Show not as good as the other Honeymooners But still Great","1937":"The lead actress was good. That is about all I can say.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great.  Purely a time=killer.","1938":"This is a fun, engrossing made for TV movie which lives up to it's billing of providing mindless entertainment with a good dose of conspiracy, uber-bad guys and even a romantic interest.  Fun if you have the time.","1939":"This movie was really cute and had good characters however it was not as good as the book. There were a few missing parts that were in the book and not in the movie. I would recommend the movie if you are looking for a cute kids movie, especially for young boys but read the book first!","1940":"This movie is all about Peaches and Onions with a family curse thrown in. There are this kids in a Texas youth \"camp' who are made to dig holes all day. Punishment just got a new low in a Disney movie here. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0007PICAS\">Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (Widescreen Edition)<\/a> has this kind of kids tale and romantic feel to it. What I don't like is how they make it seem like treating these kids this way was a natural \"Texas\" thing. I'm afraid to think about widows and orphanes in a Texas like this.","1941":"The movie was ok, it wasn't wow or anything, but it is a good movie to watch when you're bored. I thought the book was much better though.","1942":"I watched this film with one of my friends,in the end he told me please delete my mobile number from your cell phone !","1943":"not as good as either movie i do suggest you get both movie verions","1944":"With a story based on a PC game, the negative feelings of these movies is purly justified. Although the story is quite good it still resorts to many old cliches such as the cool fad of \"MTV\" editing and the lack plot, as linear as it is. It still has its quirks but you are left feeling yes it has good effects and yes it has an alright story... but not much else.","1945":"This was a good movie but was not good as the predators or as the aliens. This was better than I expected it was going to be, but it is not as good as Alien VS. Predator REQIUM.","1946":"I concur with another reviewer that stated not much more was put into this edition.  Rent it and make up your own mind before  wasting the money if you already have the original version.  If you don't the buy this one.  Kind of a waste of money for those  of us who bought the origanal, then bought this anyway, but I traded my old one in and got some decent cash to put towards this one so no harm.  But again, if you already have the origanal, don't waste your money.","1947":"Maybe it's because I'm a fan of each of these creatures, but I enjoyed this movie.  It took a little while for it to get going, with many slow moving sequences to get through.  But the fight scenes were excellent throughout the movie.  I wanna give 4 stars for this movie, but there are areas where it could have been better, so I'll leave it at 3 stars.  Not a bad movie once it finally gets going.  Watch & enjoy.  Larry","1948":"It just wasn't the same without Ripley. I read the silly \"novelization\" before I saw the movie. Glad I did. It was poor writing, but it explained some of what was going on. Overall, the movie was disappointing. It was fun seeing the aliens again, but I was not given a reasont o care whether the explorers survived or not. Event hough this movie was not the best - I did like the set up for a sequal.","1949":"I fully disagree with people that say this movie was not good because it was PG-13.  Even the director used this excuse saying that the studio changed his movie.  What bullsplit.  Granted there may have been less blood (although it was pretty bloody for a PG-13 film), but the movie did not fail in that aspect.  The movie was entertaining but failed in respects to actually pitting the Aliens vs Predator.  There were too few fight scenese.  The film turned out to be more focused on the human plight.","1950":"I was expecting more, I'll admit. A lot of this film didn't make sense and the history of the Aliens was played around a bit too much. Shortened gestation periods? Gregory turns in a top notch performance (as usual) as the Predator. Nice to see that CalArts education paying off for him.","1951":"Chronologically, it predates all the Aliens movies, the setting is 2004.  Typical military sci-fi, you don't need a review to tell you what happens to the cast, one by one.  And if you're already familiar with the Predator movies, you'll be screaming at the TV, \"DON'T TOUCH THE GUN!\"  Did I mention the ending is pdf - pretty darn funny?  As Jayne from 'Firefly' would say, \"High-Larious\".","1952":"AVP is entertaining, but also awful. It's the biggest guilty pleasure out there. What's next Chucky V. The Leprachaun?","1953":"If you're going to see this movie, I highly recommend you have a bag of popcorn. Although the build-up is a bit long, I enjoyed the tension and the suspense (the popcorn helps the time go by). I was not disappointed with the final 30 minutes. There's lots of green fluids flying over the place. One thing I 'd had done differently is to have had more Predators and Aliens fighting. Initially only 3 Predators come to Earth to hunt the Aliens.  Forget about the plot holes, if you want a good action-horror movie , AVP is it!","1954":"I enjoyed this movie but I think it could have been an awesome movie.  The story was pretty interesting and I enjoyed the fights, but they could have been a lot longer.  I was a bit disappointed that the fights between the aliens and predators were not very long or to many of them.  I was hoping for a big fight that would last a while, but most of them were extremely quick.  It was still entertaining but with the pg-13 rating it was obvious this movie was not going to be what it could have been.","1955":"I found the movie to be short, sweet mindless fun...A satisfying popcorn movie.  See it with no expectations, turn off your brain and you won't be disappointed.  A pleasant surprise.","1956":"AGAIN, here we have a movie THAT should be heard in DTS, and because of extras there is no room left for the DTS soundtrack. I thought 20th Century Fox was commited to the DTS mode.  Universal isn't any longer.  SO SAD!!!!!!!!!!!!","1957":"this ALIEN vs PREDATOR is ok...nothing brilliant, but a decent movie for the clash of the 2 coolest aliens of the galaxy...While Alien is some kind of alien parasite, brutal and without much thoughts, the Predator is a more humanoid form, with interstellar weapons and some war techniques...They are soooo cool! By far the best alien characters of all time!!!!","1958":"It moive is worth a rent its not the best story in the world not much to speak of in kills it took over 30 minutes for the first kill to happen and then close to anothere 30 minutes for the first Alien Vs Predateor fight and not what I was expecting I'm not going to say what happen but this over all good moive but rent don't buy save your money for the Director Cut of this moive I hope that it will be Unrated Version","1959":"The movie was good, but not spectacular. The action scenes were well done, as well as the overall acting.  I just think there could've been more to AVP. I expected more action scenes and a better storyline...but, that wasn't the case.  I've never seen the ALIEN or PREDATOR movies, but I think I've become more interested.","1960":"It's a good movie, but the beginning is extremley boring and alot of the action looks fake. It does have good action in it (which takes up 2\/4 of the film), but still, it's not very good.","1961":"im 13 its a ok movie not scary but fun","1962":"Two great species bleeding and killing for us, in a ritual game of death.  This, too, is the existence of our undead brothers on all planets.  So, please, filmmaker, give us the honor of knowing the alien and the predator as bretheren, not as evil ones.  We must learn to hate the night no more.  Only then will the bloodletting become painless, and part of the light.","1963":"Good package a little short on the extras but they still expanded the story. Good buy for any fan","1964":"GREAT potencial, very god to watch, but a bit too short and definately needs more alien\/predator 1 on 1 ACTION.","1965":"well just finished watch AVP and i have to say it left me wanting more, more dialog, more action, more overall movie (too short), less predators dying so fast, and the ending just leaves you hanging, nice set up for a sequel; but is a sequel ever going to be made? all in all i thought the movie was decent. was better than ok, but not pretty good, it was decent.","1966":"I HAVE TO ADMIT AFTER WATCHING ALL THE ALIEN MOVIES, I WOULD PUT THIS ALONG SIDE THE OTHER ONES. \"ALIEN & ALIENS\".  IT'S WORTH WATCHING.  LOTS OF EXCITMENT.  SANAA LATHAN, WAS PRETTY GOOD IN THIS FLICK.  ANOTHER FLICK, FOR ANY MOVIE BUFFS COLLECTION","1967":"The Bottom Line:  The Cranes are Flying is an absolutely gorgeous movie, with excellent cinematography and direction, but it's very manipulative at times, often unrealistic (it's wartime in Russia but everyone seems well-fed and clothed) and the characters don't always seem fully fleshed-out--if you're interested in Russian cinema then see it but don't expect a masterpiece, photography excepted.","1968":"The description piqued my interest in this video, but it was probably more for people who do this sort of thing for a living. It's OK, but for me at least, it wasn't as interesting as it was cracked up to be.","1969":"Movie had some great characters and clever dialog, but the ending was a thorough disappointment. I recommend you watch this movie, but don't be surprised if you hate it.","1970":"I remember being very excited to see this film after all the press it received when it came out.. However, I was disappointed by it somewhat.  A  much better movie than &quot;School Daze,&quot; it still wasn't as clever  in its way as his first film, &quot;She's Gotta Have It.&quot;  At least  Criterion is again attempting to present some contemporary films.  Everything they have put out in the last year has been restorations of  films from the 30s for some weird reason.","1971":"**1\/2 2004. Directed by Peter Chelsom. Average Hollywood gauged product about a man who discovers that he likes to dance. No artistic ambition here, just a camera that films Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon as if they were passing in front of the camera of your cell phone. The definitive movie about ballroom dancing still is Australian director Baz Luhrmann's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00005V1Y0\">Strictly Ballroom<\/a>. This one is already forgotten.","1972":"I bought it as a gift. She watches it alone, and can't get enough of him.","1973":"This movie is not really bad at all...sort of predictable in my opinion...so you know what is going to happen and why it happened. It was a good natured film, I would recommend it for anyone...even the kids...even though it is a Pg-13 rating, I see no problem with a kid under 13 watching this film, and I am a father of a 9 year old...great choregraphy in the film as well.  Wish I could have seen a better acting performance from J Lo.  Blonde lady in the film is really funny!!!","1974":"It wasn't bad, I just hoped for more I guess.  There were a few scenes that came across as plain silly and ridiculous thus making it hard to watch at times.  Richard Gere tries hard but I thought Lopez's performance was best, really quiet and understated.  Susan Sarandon's role wasn't very challenging, for an actress that talented, you'd have thought they'd have given her more.","1975":"This movie clearly is a big piece of fluff, but it has some warm, fun moments that make it much more palatable than I would have expected.  Gere is charming here.  It's nice to see him smile in movies these days. Sarandon, as is often the case, rises above the flimsy material.  Anita Gillete (I know!) is kind of a hoot and Tucci contiues to be a scene stealer.  Oh yeah, JLo is in it too.","1976":"Not particularly moving or life-changing but an alright way I suppose to pass two hours of your life. Well-acted (especially Stanley Tucci), but Jennifer Lopez's mysterious sadness act was sort of hokey. John Clark's (Gere)fourteen year old daughter is an annoying self-centered brat whose completely unnecessary actions bring embarrassment to her dad's dancing partner, and they could have done the film without her.  Maybe he took up ballroom dancing to get away from this kid, not his wife.  One of those \"all's well that ends well\" type movies.","1977":"The other reviews have much worthwhile to say, so I'll focus on what I find missing in the film. With all the action, where are the moments of reflection by the Solomon character or others who might have clarified his situation for him?  Above all, he was an individual who responded to his circumstances in a unique way.  Although he miraculously survived, his sense of himself and what is true must have been severely damaged.  He was abused.  I wonder how he lived the rest of his life and did he heal from his traumas?","1978":"War, Full Frontal Male Nudity, reasonable acting, what more could one ask for? Yes, definately a good addition to any homoerotic war movie collection ;)","1979":"This is a fabulous movie for anyone with a heart. It explores the relationship of two young men growing up, which is difficult in itself, but than you have the added complexity of sexuality. This is a heart felt &amp; moving tale of relationships and love. The DVD itself is a big disappointment, the Chinese subtitles which CANNOT be removed can be a distraction too. This movie is a classic, you won't want to miss it.","1980":"This wasn't the best DVD I've seen, but it was still much better than VHS. The 2 channel Dolby was quite clear, as was the picture. There's no chapter search in the menu, but the movie is split into 16 chapters; allowing for using the DVD's controls to skip or jump to a specific chapter. The always-on subtitles were a disappointment and the chapter breaks were apparently chosen randomly, but overall it's worth it for anyone who can't stand VHS.","1981":"I like this movie, it has a lot of controversial things going on in it with a lot of big hollywood names. I wish it went more into details about the decisions that were made. All in all a decent movie to kill time.","1982":"Lighthearted, easy-on-the-brain animated flick about dinosaurs coming &quot;back&quot; to visit NYC. Predictably (since this is animated stuff), they are friendly and an evil circus owner wants to exploit them. Kids fare should appeal to 2nd and 3rd graders, with fairly good animation and great voices. As for people older than nine, stick to Jurassic Park, a truly absorbing, much much more successful dinosaur film made the same year and directed by the producer of this one, Spielberg.","1983":"I guess most of you who have order this DVD like the movie, so I could forget about reviewing the story! The fact is, this is the 1st Universal animation presented in anamorphic widescreen! There is zero extra on this DVD, but I'm glad it finally released! Color is vibrant, and sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1,  So, are they going to release the rest of their animation in DVD, like The American Tail and it sequel, and The Land Before Time? I wish .......","1984":"Kinda weird and a lot if sex in it. I like suspense movies but I didn't realize it was so sexual. Aside that it was good.","1985":"The violence was something that is in a lot of films, so that didn't bother me. I didn't particular care for Alba getting her face punched in, but that's just me. Like a few of the others, I thought then ending was simply horrible. I won't spoil it for anyone, but why the hell would they let her get that close in the first place?","1986":"Very different movie. Catches you off guard if you hadn't read the book. Psychotic creepy like the movie, A Simple Plan.","1987":"well i finally got the want to watch it after purchasing it, oh i dont know how long ago. but i didnt really like the beating of the women at all. ouch! actually the first reason i didnt like it was because it was a western, i think, and im not really a western fan. all the actors did very well in their parts, of course. is not a bad movie. now wonder when ill want to see \"ride with the devil\"","1988":"This movie was better than I expected.  Jessica Alba revamped her sexiness, and did a good job.  The movie's plot doesn't seem like the movie can be interesting but it is. All the actors did a good job, and the movie keeps you hooked and into it.  I gave it three stars because it's worth a watch.","1989":"Enjoyable the first time, might have given 4 stars but every time I see it I don't know why I liked it so much the first time around.  My advice- watch it once","1990":"The product that I received is in great condition however, it didn't come as quickly as I expected. Would recommend using again.","1991":"Rudy (Special Edition)  Rudy was an inspiring movie based upon a true story that is an example of determination and perserverence.  Truly a classic.  However, I truly believe that this wonderful story fell from a perfect 10 to a lower number due to some of the phrases that defame the God who made life and accomplishment possible.","1992":"Needed to view this inspirational film for school. It arrived on time, in good condition and was a wonderful movie to watch.","1993":"This was a gift - I would not pick such a movie. The story is good and inspiring, but the cussing increases as the movie progresses.  So, if you like cussing, this movie is for you - there is no shortage of foul words here.","1994":"Even tho the movie is in english...everything written is half english and half spanish...urg Deceiving pictures. I purchased the third movie of the series as well and its also the same way...half spanish and half english","1995":"Not much action, the film focuses more on how Bella takes the fact that Edward is gone, no big deal.","1996":"i wasn't expecting to like it that much cause, im not a big twilight fan, but that been said, the movie was so much better than twilight, the new director thankfully new what he was doing, so it was so much better than the first one.  this special edition is very nice, loved the packaging and the cover and everything.  it doesnt include all the special fetures that it shuld cause they spread them into 3 different special edition DVD's but this one is quite nice","1997":"the movie came in great shape but unfortunately it had no case and since it was a gift I returned it.","1998":"the movie could never surpass the book, However i felt that the movie led you to a point and as you hold your heart and breathe, your are left in limbo we need to know what is going on. My thirteen year old turned me on to the saga and i have been hooked ever since. I am hungry to find out what the next step is ...... other than that this story is magnificently written and directed.","1999":"the movie itself was good, but it did not keep with the book as much as was expected.","2000":"The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all! It is just great! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there. After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51. What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past! You will never regret buying this DVD.","2001":"I have all of the doo wop DVD's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones. Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again. Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE this DVD !!","2002":"The performance of Little Anthony and the Imperials singing &quot;Two Kinds of People&quot; acappella is worth the price of admission; they haven't lost a step!  The rest is simply gravy.","2003":"Get it, also get Dop Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51. Each performances is like the original 45's, except with modern, nice ,crisp sound like today's cds.","2004":"Excellent, excellent performers.  Excellent video and audio quality.  Buy this DVD and go back in time.  Well worth the time waiting for almost a year to get hold of the DVD.","2005":"This video is awesome and of particular interest to anyone who grew up with the great music of the 50's and 60's.  The Duprees were wonderful!  Also, Jay Black's Cara Mia gave me goose bumps.  It doesn't matter how old these guys are, they can still belt out quite a song.  Little Anthony and the Imperials were also very, very good!  They have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it!  The backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise. This is one you do not want to miss!  I recommend it HIGHLY!","2006":"As owners of a Yellow Lab, we just might be a bit biased, but we were mesmerized by this movie.  The adventures of a lost boy and dog.  Of course the ending is predictable.  We knew that.  But the story line, the fabulous scenery, the cinematography, the acting, the sub-plots and the adventure make this a must-see movie for the whole family - Preview it before showing it to the very young; they might be traumatized by the scary parts.  Buy \"Far From Home...\"  a guaranteed winner.  You'll be watching it over and over again.","2007":"This is by far one of the best American Movies, that I have seen in a very long time. It was indeed a true American reality show.","2008":"I have no words, really my wife would not stop mourn the end of the movie.intense, surprising, sad, happy, sentimental, inspiring, emotional,","2009":"A refreshing, family movie!  A dog finds a boy, boy keeps dog only if he takes complete care of him.  Dog, he names Yellow, becomes boys best friend.  A functional family teaching their son responsibility.  The scenery in this movie is beautiful. You will laugh, smile, and have tears....ending with joy.  Years ago we purchased this movie for ourselves after seeing it on HBO.  We have since purchased it for adults and for children.","2010":"The first time I viewed this film I was a young teen. Now as a 29 year old guy I find this film just as entertaining as I did all those years ago. In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films.","2011":"My sister and her husband requested this movie...thanx for delivering it in a timely manner...","2012":"This is my grandson's favorite movie, and he watches it over and over again.  A boy lost in the NW rainforest with his dog, who saves his life.  Great stuff.  A real tear-jerker, too.","2013":"This is a fantastic movie for the whole family. The scenery was incredible in the movie.","2014":"They just dont make movies like this any more. A great movie for any movie library a must have. One you will bring out to watch for years to come!","2015":"My family loved this adventure, especially my boys, 7 & 8.  We laughed, we cried, it became a part of us.... ;)","2016":"The movie still amazes and touches me even seeing it for the 3rd time. I want to see this movie everytime i remember my dog, Huck Finn - i can say he is also a yellow dog.  The actors are great. The pictures are all natural.","2017":"Just like the title says, Good Family Video. This movie+ your family + popcorn = Great family night with the kids.","2018":"Our family really enjoys this movie.  The story is not terribly predictable and the actors all do a solid job.  Beautiful scenery and enough action to keep the little ones engaged.  Should be on DVD.  We'll add it to our collection.","2019":"I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out.  It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion.  Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending (of Course).  I am Disney's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others. (P.S.  I am a Grandmother to eleven.)  Thank heavens for Disney Movies.","2020":"It is a funny movie, but I think there is way too much cursing, it takes away from the movie....","2021":"It's a comedy who done it, featuring alot of the old school hip-hop artists. After seeing the movie on BET recently it brought back all of the good memories relating to the actors and the musicians and I went searching to buy a copy.","2022":"I won't claim to know all of the rappers that are contained in the movie but it is a good laugh much as \"Car 54 where are you?\" with Rosi O is. Plus, Dennis Leary is great and \"Duff\" from MTV (VJ around 1990-91) also makes a cameo.....very cute! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh.  MJ","2023":"This is a great movie especially if you were a young adult during the early 90's.  Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are a great pair, very funny.  Dennis Leary is hysterical.  So many quotable quotes!  The parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie. It's not a serious movie, more like really long funny skit.","2024":"Though it was never an Oscar contender, it was funny as h***!!!","2025":"This video covers phonics to a deep extent, and may be a little too much for beginners. Mouth movement is included, and is an extremely useful learning tool. Occasionally, however, they just show the lip movement without showing pictures of the object corresponding to the word. Nevertheless, my son is a fast learner so it worked out perfectly for us. A hidden gem.","2026":"Very good movie. And unlike many Chinese movies, it does not have a totally sad ending where everyone, especially the hero, gets killed!","2027":"The Reaper is a fantastic show filled with wild scenarios on how Sam and friends have to catch the different souls that escaped from Hell.  The only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons.  I already bought the show in HD via Xbox Live.  Glad to see it on Amazon.com VOD.  I would have bought from here first if it was available at the time.  Wish show would come out on Blu-ray.  Season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment.  Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode. Enjoy.","2028":"This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous!  It was even fun listening to the request call-ins.  Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live.  Love those guys!! Also, they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts.  I highly recommend this DVD!","2029":"of course it's really good to hear all the Bee Gees Jams on a Album but live is even better.the only down side is the fact that some of the songs are done in Medley form&that kinda leaves it just there overall to me.but all in all this is a real good show&performance.","2030":"I own this DVD, along with their \"One Night Only\" DVD, & I have to tell you--I love 'em both!! They sound just as good (or better) as when they were younger--I play one after the other at times (there are a few new songs on \"This Is Where I Came In\") on my stereo, set for DTS--ohhhh the sound is INCREDIBLE!!  I catch myself \"boogie-ing\"(not sure how to spell that--sorry) constantly...I'm 31 years old & LOVE the Bee Gees!!  What more can I say? :)","2031":"Kind of bogus request.  Too much of their newest material. Get the One Night Only!","2032":"I purchased two DVDs, one for my parents who are huge Bee Gee fans (they're in their late 60s) and one for myself.  As African Americans our (my family) taste in music is culturally diverse and the Bee Gees are on the top of our lists.  This concert is a definite must see ranking right up there with their \"One Night Only\" concert.  Several songs on this DVD I've never heard before but they have become my favorites. The Bee Gees were very playful\/silly\/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group.","2033":"This is a fine performance by the Bee Gees who perform \"by request\", probably the most difficult format for live performers.  They play most of their songs and most fans might complain about various hits that were omitted.  Still an enjoyable performance.","2034":"Although this movie is broke up into two different parts, it was very good.  Since the movie was done in two parts, the second one repeats a lot as if one was not there to view the first part.  I did not like that at all.  The point to this movie is really good.  I'm actually going to send it to someone that has held \"life\" against God.  This is an excellent ministering tool!!","2035":"This DVD was very helpful for those who had lost a loved one in our family of faith. It was able to show that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones are gone from here --- they are still with us in spirit. It made our faith stronger and brought our family closer together in God's love. Louie Giglio is a Christian who's spirit sends a loving message from his heart.","2036":"This is an amazing video for those who are suffering. When life hurts most, when the bottom falls out, when tragedy strikes I need to know, \"Is there still hope for me?\" Louie answers a resounding YES. He explores the topic of suffering better than anyone I've heard. I was deeply inspired by this two-part video series. I recommend you buy it if you're hurting.","2037":"This two part video tells where our only Hope lies, in Jesus Christ.  Louis is a great communicator who uses stories about real people and the Word of God to point out our only hope when difficulties in life arise, and they will.  It is a great resource for encouragement when life's hurts hit.  I recommend it to anyone, believer in Christ or not.","2038":"Great encouragement on the intricate involvement in the lives of people. I actually sent the DVD's to friends going through challenges with their 17 year old son who has left home.","2039":"Louie has some of the most inspirational an thought provoking sermons I have ever heard. He is truly anointed!","2040":"This is one of my all-time favorite movies for escaping from worldly work.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce have great chemistry and the trials of Edmond Dantes are laid out (although too brief for me) in historically correct detail. Even though this movie loosely follows Dumas' book, the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits.","2041":"LOVE this movie - loved it when it first came out and still love it - awesome shots and wonderful story line....Jim C is an AMAZING actor!","2042":"This movie has everything I like: a great story and plot with suspense, lots of action, some comedy, romance and great effects. No question - I had to buy it.","2043":"Great Blu-ray DVD for the price!  The graphic and sound quality is excellent.  The product was received less than 7 days and was well packaged.","2044":"I love this movie! Sure, the acting isn't oscar worthy, but the characters are interesting in this classic story. It also helps that Jim Caviezel is smoking HOT in this remake of Dumas' famous story.","2045":"I love to read and am normally disappointed in the movies which are based on those books. This is the exception. Great, believable characters. Excellent character development. And some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested.","2046":"I have to say I was so impressed with this movie.  It is a great movie, and though not a Christian movie, it has a lot of God themes mingled in between.  I highly recommend this movie.  I am buying 2 other to give away.  SEE it, you will not be disappointed.","2047":"I should have read the book by now!  That's what I was thinking as I was halfway through this particular version--the only movie version I've seen so far.  The cast is okay, though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating.  The hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively, and I totally understand Dantes' (sp?) desire for revenge, although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all.","2048":"The movie was great I like it I actually ordered as a gift I already own it.  The price was good and so was the delivery.  Happy with the order.","2049":"The Count Of Monte Cristo is an all around great movie. You have an excellent story line and plot. You get action, suspense, romance and even a couple of laughs. All this in a movie without nudity, sex or bad language. There is violence, but not in the excessive, graphic way we have come to expect from Hollywood. This movie is proof positive that you don't have to have explicit sex, language or blood and guts to have a great movie! I highly recommend it.","2050":"Richard Harris and Guy  Pearce made this movie great. All of the actors were superb and I think that the actual Chateau D'If was used. Superb in every way except not long enough.","2051":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a promising film, not as good as the original novel, but if it promises to get some interested in reading the book by Dumas, than it is worth watching.  Richard Harris is always a pleasure to watch when he plays of character of Education or Tutoring.","2052":"Sit back and enjoy the interesting and exciting story of the Count Of Monte Cristo. Great rainy day movie!","2053":"Great movie.  Saw it once and had to have it.  Mail delivery was prompt.","2054":"I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this movie in theaters, but I loved the whole movie.  The action, plot, suspense...wonderfully wrapped into this movie.  I enjoyed the movie so much that I have started to read the book.  A classic book and great movie. Revenge is so well portrayed in this movie.  Vengence, honor, love, justice.  So good!  This is my favorite movie to date!","2055":"So much better than any movie I have seen lately.  I had never read the book or seen the movie and I just loved it.  It captured my imagination and the acting was so believable.  Jim C. was the Count.  I want to see it again and again.","2056":"This is a wonderful movie. I bought this for my Mom she just loves it! The process was extreamly fast and hastle free at Amazon.","2057":"ACTION,ADVENTURE, INTRIGE, ROMANCE this movie has it all.This is Jim's finest film...he was better in this than the PASSION OF THE CHRIST. I have never read the book, but, I probably will now.  There is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists. I am amazed that the casting Director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly.  In addition, the young man that played Jim's son must be his brother, cousin,etc in real life because he looks just like him. The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying.","2058":"A very well-done film and an excellent cast.  I'd put it right up with the Three and Four Musketeers movies (York, Reed, Chamberlain, Heston, etc).","2059":"This is an excellent movie and I never read the book.  The acting and the plot was very nice done, it is one of my favorite movies.","2060":"It is one of the best films I have seen and seen and seen. I can't tell you how many times I have watched this movie and still enjoy watching it again. The acting is surperb and the quality of the story is deep, entertaining, and thought provoking. An awesome buy and the purpose of owning is to watch it and watch it again and again if not why not just rent.","2061":"This is a great movie.  That many people don't know about.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce do great acting.  I think after Guy Pearce's performance, I won't like him if I ever meet him in real life.  He makes his character so dis likable.  Which is the point!","2062":"There is nothing bad to say about this movie.  The story, the acting, everything is well done.  I bought it to watch over and over.","2063":"Very good acting!  A bad guy you love to hate.  Very romantic.  Feel good story.  Action.  A little adventure and definitive intriguge!  It all makes for an excellent story you will enjoy.","2064":"This is a movie that should be included in everyones cinema collection!  The scenes and fantastic cast taps into every emotion.  I was at the edge of my seat for more than one scene!  I will enjoy watching this movie for years to come.","2065":"This is one of the best films I have seen. It's in great shape, I don't remember, but it may have been new. It works perfectly, and I am so lucky to own it.","2066":"The first time I watched this movie, my cousin brought it over to my house on a movie night.  when she said what she was bringing to watch, i said \"what? the count of who?\"  never heard of it and immediately assumed that it would be not worth my time.  I was mistaken.  I could not take my eyes off of the movie and spent the next 2 hours enthralled.  if you are wondering whether this is worth the money.....spend it, you'll definately be happy you did.","2067":"This is, by far, the best rendition for the big screen of the novel by Dumas (although it's not 100% close to the book) and, by far, one of the best movies in recent years. What other movie do you remember going to, where, at the end, while the titles scroll, a roar of applause comes from the audience? I've lended my DVD to a few skeptic friends and all not only liked the movie, they LOVED IT! Wonderfully acted, with wonderful scenery, this movie truly deserves more credit that it has gotten. STARS hands down!","2068":"If you like movies like Braveheart, The Patriot, and Gladiator, then you will enjoy The Count of Monte Cristo. Rating: Buy","2069":"the perfect movie great plot exceptional ending must see movie","2070":"Do you remember having to read this story in high school literature? I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now.  The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination.  It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance, intrigue, sword fights, action. Definitely a movie to add to your collection.","2071":"I very much enjoyed this iteration of the Count. It was well filmed and well acted. It makes a person think of what they would do if they suddenly got very rich and had blood enemies. Would you seek revenge or would you be fat and rich? Guy Peirce gives a wonderful performance. Rent this movie you will like it and probably want to purchase it.","2072":"I love, LOVE this movie. I could watch it over and over and over again... I'm so glad I could find it online. Jim plays his role well.","2073":"Amazing movie. I saw it in a huge tv screen after hooking up my computer in my tv. The quality was amazing and the speed just perfect like a DVD.","2074":"BEST MOVIE EVER. Love the book, love the movie. You can't go wrong with this classic, so I would definitely recommend it!","2075":"Enjoyed the movie and enjoyed having access for 48 hours. It's good to have such easy access to good movies.","2076":"I have always loved this movie and now I can see it on the go! The picture quality is awesome! U won't regret gettin this movie","2077":"This is my Gransons Favorite movie and we needed an extra copy cuz our old one was WEARING OUT! Thanks for speedy service too!","2078":"I rented this movie to have a small idea of what it was about because I was monitoring the homework of a 9th. grader tasked with reading the book and answering questions.  It seems to have followed the book fairly closely.  At least I could ask relative questions.  It was well worth the rental fee.","2079":"We were highly entertained. It is a very well made movie with good acting for the most part. Can't go wrong with it.","2080":"I have watched this movie numerous times. I have always enjoyed the overall theme of this movie. I will probably watch it again.","2081":"Jim Caviezel was great in this movie. Guy Pearce also played a great role. The new Superman Henry Cavill plays Albert Mondego the son of of The Count.","2082":"Great version of a Classic book & movie! If you like\",Get Back,\" movies this is a must see.  The Counts character starts of as a vindictive person ,when released from his prison,but learns to forgive to save the thing he loves the most.","2083":"I purchased this dvd for two reasons.  One , I've read the book many times, and it is a classic. I have seen many of the other productions, and I wanted too see how this one compared.  Two, I am a BIG fan of Jim Caviezel, and wanted to see his portrayal of the Count.  I was not disappointed on either count! It was timely and acting very well done.  I had seen this when it first came out, but seeing Person of Interest every week, I decided to buy the Count.  Great dvd for a fan!","2084":"Amazing movie about love & deception. If you are in to suspense movies, definitely check this one out. Really great film.","2085":"great movie and purchasing it was so easy. I received my order in just a couple of days.  Highly satisfied.","2086":"Everything did exactly what I needed it to do. Thank you also for being prompt and for getting me this so quickly.  The cover was a little torn when it arrived.","2087":"I really recommend this movie, I think is one of the best movies ever, I can't get tired of watched. I just love it!!!!","2088":"Arrived withing the time period listed. DVD had popped loose from post inside case (probably occurred during shipping)and disc was slightly scratched. Played fine and have no complaints.","2089":"This must be the greatest revenge movie ever; despite the somewhat goofy cast and seeing it countless times never fails to bring on the tears. This is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I am forever a fan of Alexandre Dumas's most infamous work.","2090":"This is a very good DVD, romantic and somewhat historical. It takes place around the time of Napolean's exile. I have watched this many times and have shared it with teenagers, who also love it.","2091":"I love this movie! When I couldn't find it in my local stores and needed it right now I was able to get it for a reasonable price(was a birthday present to myself). I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, action-packed experience!","2092":"What is so wrong with making a movie and changing the story or plot a little.  As if Dumas' books are sacred writ...so many struggle to find any value in an adaptation.  If you ask me this movie was far more entertaining than either the book or any of the earlier films of the same title.  I enjoy a great rewrite.","2093":"The service was fast and the dvd is new as I ordered it. So I am a very satisfied customer. I ordered the count of monte christ dvd.","2094":"Great movie!  Enjoyable to watch and see how cleverly the hero exacts his revenge.  Not as good as the book but similar.  Well made, great acting, one you can watch again and again!","2095":"This CD was very good. The view of the movie was good, and it came in a timely fashion.  I really enjoyed watching this movie.  Thank you.","2096":"I really enjoyed this movie. Does not follow the book really, but thats ok because I felt the movie was better. Overall, very enjoyable.","2097":"While this movie defers from the book it is an amazing modern rendition of a classic novel. Good actors, costumes, and a good director bring this movie together into what I believe is one of the best versions of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" to date.","2098":"This is a great movie with a little of everything. When one friend betrays another, it sends the main character life in a downward spiral. It is only at his lowest that someone comes and gives him the strength and intelligence that he so needs to plot his revenge on his betraying friend, whom he finds out married his to-be wife. If you are looking for a great movie to watch this would be it. 10 out of 10.","2099":"DVD was delivered very fast, and was in perfect condition. Thank you for a great transaction. Would highly reccomend to everyone.","2100":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the my favorite books. This movie is now one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to everyone!","2101":"This was the first movie I viewed with Jim Caveizel acting. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, writing, and acting. It is an excellent story of redemption and justice. It has long been a favorite with our Family!","2102":"Such a good story, I bought the book and dvd for my husband for christmas and he is really enjoying both!","2103":"This is a great movie if you are looking for action and adventure. Has great actors and a great storyline.","2104":"Great Movie, I had seen it years ago and wanted to see it again and it was just as good the secound time around.","2105":"This is a great movie. My wife watches it over and over, about 7 times now.","2106":"This is such a great re-make of the original that starred the late \"Tony Curtis\".  I love this movie.","2107":"Good movie but ends differently from the book.  Had I not read the book, I would have enjoyed it more.  I bought the VHS used at a very good price.  I was very pleased.","2108":"Action, Adventure & Love.  Great movie for teens and adults.  From rags to riches; good verses evil theme. Revenge is bad and doing what is right is the lesson.  Great acting and a great story!","2109":"The director did a fine job in that he appealed to the 21st century audience.  The action involved and the forgiveness given to his love was not in the original book but I would not have enjoyed the movie unless he allowed for this change.  The original book was a bit morose.","2110":"Arrived quickly and excellently packaged. DVD in even better condition than description. Very happy.","2111":"Great Movie I recommend to anyone to watch it....original movie, excellent condition..and on time shipping..","2112":"This is a very complex book that encompasses many years.  The movie did a very good job of keying in on the events that allows someone who never read the book to understand the characters, situation and message.  One of mine and my husband's favorites (book and movie).  Laura in Texas","2113":"One of my favorite movies of all time. James Caviezel is excellent in his role as the count. Set on revenge for a serious injustice he ends up with some good fortune that runs his way while in prison. Sets the rest of the movie to plot against the very men that caused his demise. Great Movie!","2114":"the disk of the dvd i bought was in good condition but i waited quite a while for it to get to me, so that is my only complaint with this purchase","2115":"We always enjoy seeing this adaptation of the Dumas' book.  The movie flows well and the story (though familiar) is interesting and exciting.  The story, \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", inspired other great works and movies such as the movie, \"The Shawshank Redemption\"- one of the best films of all time.  This movie will appeal to all ages.  Great movie.  JR Felisilda Author of the book \"Nanay: Lessons from a Mother\"","2116":"having read this book in grade school, it made a huge impression on me... so how great to find this film three decades later and share with my daughter. thought the execution was fantastic, and the departures from the script did not bother me, though i do plan to grab a copy of the book and re-read it.  highly recommended.","2117":"My order was shipped so quickly, it was great. I received the movie with no complications which is not always true when ordering things off the internet.","2118":"This movie is a classic - the perfect combination of action\/adventure, intrigue, and romance. It's amazing.","2119":"This addition of the famous story is mostly to be recommended. The acting is first rate and 'Mercedes' is a knock out. The movie works very well even though it doesn't follow strictly to the book. My only criticism is it's scanty treatment of the part of the story where Dantes ( The Count ) rescues his old employer and friend from ruin by setting him up with a new ( replica of his original one ) boat. This is one of the central parts of the story and deserved more screen time than it got.","2120":"This movie is top notch. The acting and filming is excellent, as is the story line. It conveys a message of hope, eventual justice, the futility of grudge-bearing and the merits of generousity. The action is attention holding and the movie has no dull spots. I watch it on average once per month.","2121":"One of the best Movies I have seen in many years. Jim Caviezal will become a national treasure. Up there with Morgan Freeman,Hoffman,Redford etc. If you want to see a great movie and one to add to a collection this is it.  Brian  cleveland ohio.","2122":"It was so easy to buy the DVD I was looking for, The Count of Monte Cristo, on Amazon.com!  Even ColumbiaHouse did not have it!  I entered a search, got instant results, looked at the reviews, chose a seller and ordered a used but \"like new\", DVD. It arrived in just days and was in perfect condition!  I'm very happy with the seller and with Amazoncom!","2123":"I recieved this movie will before it was due to come to me.  Am very happy with your service. thanks for the great service.","2124":"Very entertaining movie.  I've watched it a number of times and always enjoy.  I got this copy for my granddaughter who is seventeen.  We watched it together.  There's not all that many movies out there that you can watch with your granddaughter.  Try this one.","2125":"This movie is really good. It is a little long, but it is totally worth it. It's exciting, emotional, dramatic, and captivating. Everyone should see this one!","2126":"Director Kevin Reynolds keeps you pleasantly entertained with light humor in the classic story of the Count of Monte Cristo. I look forward to seeing this movie again.","2127":"I found that the movie version of Count of Monte Cristo was much better than the book. While yes, they do differ,the book leaves you hanging while the movie closes perfectly. So if you are going to invest time, go with the movie, it's a better bet.","2128":"although movies have a time frame, it would have been great if they included some of his days as a pirate.  other than that i really like this movie.","2129":"The movie was very different from the book but it was a very good movie with excellent acting. It was worth watching.","2130":"This is a wonderful retelling of Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo. James Caviezel plays a wonderful Edmund Dantes, and a mysterious Count Of Monte Cristo.","2131":"This is one of my favorite movies!  That's why I bought it.","2132":"A movie worth watching numerous times.  An excellent cast which contributes complexity and depth to this historical fiction classic.  The movie excels at various levels.  It will remain as one of our family's all time favorites.  Everyone we have shown the movie to, in turn, snatches my movie and shows the movie to others.  I have purchased additional copies.  Appropriate for various audiences.  Tasteful and timely humor.  Not one expletive.  Eloquently executed.  Exciting and satisfying resolution.","2133":"This is one of the best revenge movies I have ever seen.  If you never see a movie again except for this one, you will be just fine.  Good Plot, Great Action, and a story to die for.","2134":"Perhaps one of the best novels ever written, the Count of Monte Cristo is a story of an innocent man that seeks to revenge his wrongful imprisonment.  Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.  <p>Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly.  This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).  <p>Truly a classic and a must read.","2135":"I never heard of this movie until someone mentioned he was named after the Dumas character in this novel.  I haven't watched the 1934 version but I have the TV miniseries with Gerard Depardieu [in French with English subtitles] and this latest version.  Of the two, the movie was definitely a notch above [both due to the choice of actor and the screenplay adaptation]. <p>I just wished I watched it with the someone beside me!","2136":"If you have read this classic tale by Alex Dumas, you won't be disappointed! This is a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up until the very end! It will exceed your expectations, I promise you! Jim Caviezel makes a great Dantes and Pearce's dialogue is truly amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","2137":"Never heard of this movie until my husband brought it home.  It was wonderful!  Thoroughly enjoyable this tale of a wronged man who takes sweet revenge on his enemies, while reigniting a lost love.<p>Why have I never heard of this film before? Surely the lead should have been nominated for an Oscar.  This film was a little violent, but can be enjoyed by the entire family.  A true gem.","2138":"I thought the movie was great, but if you decide that you love the book above all things, don't see the movie. I saw the movie before I read the book, and I really enjoy them as seperate things. The movie itself was fantastic and I really didn't find myself sitting there saying \"This is so stupid, I can't believe I paid [how much?]to see this\" or \"that could NEVER happen\". And Guy Pearce is the greatest.","2139":"I recently watched this show at the movie theater that gets all the movies later and charges [a cheaper rate] to watch them.  Well, because of that, I just recently saw this movie.  In fact, I saw it the day before I watched Star Wars Episode II, and a bit after seeing Harry Potter, and Spiderman.  Well, of all these films, The Count of Monte Cristo was the best!  Funny how my original expectations kept me from watching it as a new release...  Highly recommended!","2140":"This is a great if somewhat inaccurate rendition of the book by Alexander Dumas. The disc arrived in the condition described and very quickly. I am happy.","2141":"This was a gift to my boss. A favorite movie but he & his spouse could not find their copy. They would reach for the movie & find an empty case. Ever happen to you? They were both thrilled to get the video. I was happy that it came perfectly on time for the Christmas holiday.","2142":"I love, love, love this movie!  The acting is superb, especially the relationship between Edmond and the priest.  This movie has it all - romance, friendship, family, betrayal, murder, prison, escape, love, poverty, wealth, etc.  I've watched this at least 20 times and will watch it again someday soon.","2143":"This film has the eye candy of it's era along with the \"easy on the eyes\" Jim Caviezel! This man can not only act but wow can he reach down into your very being to touch you with his roles. I saw him in the movies; Frequency and Angel Eyes before this and he just keeps getting better!! He is a ladies heart throb and man's man all rolled into one. My husband took me to see this and also found this film to be a truly entertaining film from a man's point of view.","2144":"item ordered was in excellent condition and sent within time specified.  Very satisfied","2145":"A timeless masterpiece! A great story with terrific actors, brilliant dialogue in a beautiful location. Both Dantes (Jim Caviezel) as well as his evil friend, Mondego (Guy Pearce) were outstanding. Also the close relationship between Dantes and the Priest (Richard Harris) so touching. And who could forget Jacopo (Luis Guzman)?! Everyone I have shown this film to  (young to old) love it. You will not be disappointed!","2146":"The movie came in quicker than I expected and I am very pleased with the results","2147":"Best movies I have purchased.... betrayal, deception and the power of love.... wow worth the cost ***********","2148":"Cool action movie.  The ultimate revenge.  After wrongly suffering 11 years imprisoned, Caveziel plans retribution for his alledged best friend whose jealousy forces him too far.  Some elements are unbelievable...an old priest teaching sword fighting, a lucky treasure map leading to abundant riches, everything falling into place perfectly, but who cares...it was a lot of fun and great to see the count win out over his jealous nemesis.","2149":"An excellent movie. Exceptional performances by entire cast especially Caviezel and Richard Harris. Intriging and moving. Have watched it several times.","2150":"I owned this DVD from the time it came out, but finally just got around to watching it. I was interested to see more films with James Caviezel after watching &quot;THE PASSION&quot;. I am go glad to have finally taken the time to see it. The DVD was great and this is definitely one that I'm glad to have in my very extensive collection!!! If you haven't taken the time to see this before now, then by ALL means, do so! You will not regret it, and I guanrantee the time will fly!!","2151":"This would be a great film to watch on a date. There is revenge. There is unending love. Sword fighting. Secrecy. Treasure.<p>Edwourd returns 13 years after being wrongfully imprisoned for treason in the horrific Chateau D'if prison. Armed with the education he has learned from an imprisoned priest (Richard Harris)and the treasure he has given him he returns to bring vengeance against those that imprisoned him. His deception is masterful.<p>Look for a hidden message as well.","2152":"This is one of my all time favorite movies. No, I have not read the book yet, but, luckily, that means I can appriciate the movie for what it is, rather than what it is not. This movie was highly entertaining. It has action, drama, supense, romance, and comedy. The acting was very well done (Brownie Points for having Luis Guzman?, Richard Harris, and the Guy with the really awesome voice) and the visuals were spectacular.","2153":"The '02 release of `The Count of Monte Cristo' boasts a superb cast and lavish settings in an outstanding retelling of this classic story of romance and revenge.  James Caviezel is perfect as the outwardly stately and poised Count. However his appearance is but a mask to disguise the torment of a man imprisoned and beaten for 13 years. His only desire now is for revenge against his once best friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) who betrayed him and stole his love, the enchanting Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk).  A classic tale that can be enjoyed again and again!","2154":"If you don't want to blow yet another 4 dollars on a really bad movie, rent Count. It's a fun and irreverent retelling of the popular tale, with James Caviezel doing a great job of going from a wide eyed innocent to an 18th century version of a P. Diddy-player with a vendetta. Pearce is also great as the resident villain who struts around like an ever preening peacock(check out his overly curled bangs too-hilarious). This is just a fun movie that understood how to modernize this tale while simultaneously keeping it's more universally appealing elements....","2155":"You don't have to cover your kids eyes while watching this movie. And in these times, that is very rare. <p>The story for this movie is very good. It has a lot of character developement. You watch the star go from a poor, uneducated peasant to a wealthy count, and he uses his wealth to get revenge on those who got him imprisoned in jail for the past 11 years.<p>If you liked Frequency, or The Time Machine (same actors), then you'll enjoy this movie.","2156":"Jim Caviezel I love you.  What one does with money is only a reflection of what's in your heart.  Your true heart came out at the end.  Money is a tool.  Venenge is man's spirtual currency.  Restoration is God's.  In the end, God always wins.  Choose your side wisely.","2157":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best movies of this type (classic literature for the MTV age).  I love it, and I teach high school English.  While it is true that the movie sometimes strays far from the book, it still holds the same ideals of revenge, forgiveness, and faith.  Fabulous!","2158":"I HAVE THIS MOVIE IN VCR.  WELL, I HAD TO HAVE IT IN DVD.  THIS IS A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY","2159":"This is a great story of the Count of Monte Christo and how he became the count via the betrayal of a close friend and the tutoring of 'the prist' in prison.  Very inspiring movie I would recommend without any reservation.","2160":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE & HAVE ALWAYS  WANTED TO BUY IT.  THE QUALITY OF THE PURCHASE IS GREAT! THANK YOU MRS. LAYOW","2161":"I had been searching for a blu-ray copy of The Count of Monte Cristo and had given up.  Luckily, Amazon sends me messages when their DVDs are on sale.  This last time, there it was!  Thanks, Amazon!","2162":"This movie was better than I had ever expected, well worth the adding to your collection.","2163":"The Count of Monte Cristo is an entertaining film that we saw in the theater and then bought for home viewing.  We like it so much that, when we couldn't locate the VHS tape that we purchased, we bought a DVD copy to replace it.  We enjoy watching it again and again.","2164":"Loved Loved Loved this movie!!!!!  I can watch it over and over and over again. With the price of DVDs you need to find movies that you can watch over and over again.","2165":"I love this Movie!  Totally Addicted to it!  It actually has a plot that keeps you glued to the screen without machine guns or 5800 unnecessary boob shots! LOL I watch it at least twice a month. This is the way movies should be instead of that junk in the theaters. Jayce","2166":"I went to this movie because of two reasons:  To see Guy Pearce, and because I love this particular Dumas story.  I was immensely rewarded.  It was a faithful retelling, and it was filmed in an extremely entertaining way.  The action sequences were believable and nail-biting, and the performances of Guy Pearce, Jim Caveziel and Richard Harris were terrific.  This is the way movies used to be made.","2167":"This movie is a wonderful work of art. It should have won an Oscar! The movie is set in France with lush backgrounds and a truly incredible story based on the book by Alexander Dumas. Not only is it a terrific tale of love and survival, it is also a feast for the adventure fan. The Count of Monte Cristo is filled with enough swordfights, daring escapes, and backstabbing comrades to satisfy any viewer. I highly recommend this movie.","2168":"JAmes Caviezel was magnificant and Guy Ritchie also.  I have also seen James C play in High Crimes which he was also very good.  This is the 1st movie that I had recognized Guy Ritchie and thought he was great also.","2169":"I ordered this dvd, it came in the mail quickly, it is in perfect condition (no scratches). We have watched it 3 times already!","2170":"Ok this MOVIE is  amazing. Im tired of these people crying and saying its not the book. Yea its not the book its a MOVIE! Get it threw ur heads, all books are diff from movies. Its a great movie about love,betrayl,revange,what else do you need. The acting was great. And if your bored go read the book but if you want to watch a great MOVIE watch this epic.","2171":"I found this version more satifyling than the one with Richard Chamberline. Although the Caviezel version does not follow the book, the \"boy getting the girl\" in the end offers more satisfaction","2172":"Director Reynolds fashions a handsome, sweeping, exciting epic that keeps his audience glued in place. Pearce's Fernand is so despicably low, we cannot wait for the long-suffering Edmond to wreak vengeance. In this hugely entertaining picture, revenge is a dish served hot, and adventure fans are sure to feel sated by the end. Also, solid family viewing- with older children.","2173":"I have loved to watch this movie from the day it hit the movie theaters.  I now own it and watch it often.","2174":"I got it for my mom.  She really likes it.","2175":"One of the best movies I've seen.  Makes me feel good every time I watch it.  The good guys win.","2176":"A classic story with great acting. Great adventure. A great lesson in faith, endurance, courage. Maybe a little intense for young kids.","2177":"If you want to see the actual Dumas story, then don't watch this movie. But if you want to view an excellent movie, loosely based on the original, then DO see this movie! The film makers have gone out of their way to make the story more exciting, intriguing, and even satisfying (in places) than the original. Whereas the original is quite talky, this version is full of action, suspense, and drama--with an enjoyable satisfying climax. The acting and directing is excellent. Definitely worth seeing!","2178":"This movie provides one of the best film interpretations of Dumas' book I've seen.  Although much of the plot is cut out, realistically this movie is a great adaptation of an amazing book.  If you choose to see this movie, be sure to read the unabridged version of the book as well.  Even if you're not in it for the literature, this movie is an exciting watch regardless.","2179":"Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film! It lays out the important issue of personal finance very clear. At some point, young adults will see how important maintaining good credit, mastering a budget and committing to saving will pay off--for good or for bad.","2180":"Very enlighteniing on the development of the debt problems we all face especially how we have gotten there with many ideas as to how to decrease our debts and change our purchasing patterns.All families and individuals should view this, an eye opener.","2181":"Sharply critical of our national and personal use of debt to finance lifestyles beyond our means and an indictment of the credit\/banking\/mortgage industry engaged in predatory lending and usurious interest rates. This film came out in 2006; it's eerily prophetic of what happened to our economic house of cards in 2008.","2182":"This is clearly a great flick that lets the viewer 'see' how the banks view you the credit consumer.  It really goes into accurate detail on how the finance industry is trying to snare consumers from and young age and create a generation of debt slaves.  They also have a chilling prediction on where all this 'debt' is heading.  I highly recommend this flick.","2183":"This should be shown in all high schools and all colleges. Parents should have to show this to their children (and some should watch themselves.","2184":"I went on a debt reduction program on my own at 42 years old and now at 45 I am debt free. I recommend that you buy this DVD at any price. I also recommend that you don't watch it alone. Let some others benefit from the knowledge of what debt has and is doing to our society. Even if they don't do anything about it at least they will have the education of how the debt system works.","2185":"I made my teenager watch this movie, just so he can be aware of how corporate American busineses profit of the working class.  Very informative.A definite must see","2186":"This docu is as informative as it is depressing but needs to be watched by EVERYONE. You should buy this just for the \"indie\" debt songs sprinkled throught. I love it! Now off to spend w\/ my credit card :)","2187":"A remarkably sincere, honest, HUMAN insight into the pain Van Gogh endured. There's something humble and heartfelt about Alexander Barnett's performance that seems to me to be the most realistic portrayal of Van Gogh I have yet seen.","2188":"This was a great film. Jack Halley is comical as usual and Bela Lugos is hilarious even in his tiny role. I love this flick.","2189":"I used to watch The Time Machine in black and white TV when I was little child.  I did not understand what they said because of my deafness.  Now I just loved it in color and even closed-captioned in an excellent condition.  I just prefer to get the closed-captioned video tapes so we could enjoy to watch them.","2190":"By today's standards this movie might be weak.  The special effects are  primitive and it is not pushing H. G. Well's point.  Nonetheless, I have  watched this movie everytime it has appeared on t.v.  It has a certain  charm and innocence, not to mention that Rod Taylor derserved more work as  a leading man.  Maybe it is my &quot;guilty pleasure,&quot; but this movie  never grows tiresome. I recommend this movie to any sic-fi fan (and to  everyone else!).","2191":"It was a great book and although this movie is a bit different from the original book, the movie gives us a great look at the view of the future in the 1960's.  Obviously H. G. Well could not imagine a nuclear holocaust to destroy what we know of civilization, but it is a better explanation then what the book gives us and is easier to relate to.  H. G. Wells was trying to show us the downfall of civilization through industrialization, and the movie shows us the modern problem of the 1960's.","2192":"What a difference watching this dvd compared to watching it on vhs. The picture is so clear!  Lots of extras at the end. This is a great movie, watch it several times a year and never get tried of it.","2193":"This is one to watch if you like sci-fi films, but don't like a grotesque, horror flick. The plot is built around the traditional good versus evil with good triumphing.","2194":"This movie is one of the better quality movies from the 60's.  With very little special effects the story line is great.  The warning of what faces the world if we don't change our ways is played out very will here.  Excellent actors in Rod Taylor and Alan Young.","2195":"This film has become a fiction classic. Based in an other classic fiction writer, H.G. Wells. A must seen film for all fiction lovers","2196":"I cannot say how faithful this movie is to the book, however it is an outstanding science fiction movie.  The cinematic techniques available for this movie are not as garish as you might see today, but are nonetheless very effective in supporting the cracking screenplay.  Rod Taylor's potrayal of Wells is spot on and deserving of special note.  The sets are also exceptional with the period furniture and architecture very well done.  It is a classic story well adapted to the screen.  I recommend this movie to all true science fiction and Time travel fans.","2197":"If I only had a machine like that...... This movie get your attention and your curiosity. What would you do in the actor's shoes?. I only wish I had a machine like that....... Overall: EXCELLENT. By the way, the new version on this movie is a joke. This is the one to watch.","2198":"I used to watch this movie on ABC afternoon theater after school in the `70s. I always felt it was the best time travel movie. Having seen more recent and modern time travel movies I must admit that this one is still the best. The extras on the DVD are insightful and interesting and the movie itself has never looked better. Any Sci-Fi fan or HG Wells fan will love this movie.","2199":"I'm presently doing a \"life's review\" in that I'm accumulating old stories for my library that were popular in my days of yore. This version of THE TIME MACHINE fell into that category.","2200":"If you're watching this, then you know what you're getting into. This is one of the top sci-fi\/fantasy movies of the era alongside \"War of the Worlds,\" and \"The Day The Earth Stood Still.\"  A terrific yarn, very well acted and (for the time) great special effects. The transfer to DVD brings out the colors and clarity of the movie.  If you're a fan of 50's-60's science fiction\/fantasy, then this needs to be in your collection.","2201":"We watched this on Prime, being familiar with the story from a children's book that our kids have.  Given the age of the movie (1960) I didn't know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - the acting, the sets, and the story itself.  Obviously there are a few parts that are comically terrible given what we're accustomed to in sci-fi and CGI today.  But they don't really detract from the overall experience, and the parts that are done well are simply excellent.  Recommended.","2202":"For a film from the 50's, this one delivers. Would recommend this one to anyone, especially si-fi nuts like myself. You'll enjoy it.","2203":"George Pal's 1960 Masterpiece of Sci~Fi\/Fantasy is a delight to the eyes and ears. Spectacular colors, costumes,sets and music combine to make the Best Movie in my opinion of this genre of the early 60's. You have time travel,history lessons,girl in distress,and evil monsters.Perfect. Alongside \"Forbidden Planet\" and \"Robinson Crusoe On Mars\",this is in my Top 3 Favorite Sci~Fi Films ever!","2204":"This was one of my favorite movies growing up at the Saturday matinees. The other one being Mysterious Island. I had problems with the sound and the actors not being in sync with what they were saying. Maybe it was just my computer but it was a problem.","2205":"I heard some bad reviews on the quality of transfer but I thought It was just fine the colors werent as vibrant as the VHS I was replaceing but some people may like the colors more toned down. personally I thought It was well worth the price I paid & liked it better than the remake.","2206":"Arrived as stated and in good shape... no issues or problems included a special feature George and David Filby reunite ( both actors have aged filmed well after file was )","2207":"This movie is the best every of the time travel movies that has been made. It has good actors,very good special effects,with good background scenery. I highly recommend it.","2208":"Watching older movies, such as this one, can be quite enjoyable. There is no reliance on special effects, just what is needed to get to points. Otherwise this is a people movie commenting on Welles' vision of what may be. Rod Taylor plays his part well and for once was not the cavalier playboy as in others.  A nice piece was the featurette that included an updated visit of Welles and his friend. Nothing fancy, good watching.","2209":"As a sci-fi person, can't find movies like this anywhere except online. I've watched this movie \"Time Machine\" when I was little in the 60's, It was the greatest. Hey! in those days they did what they can as a youngster to scare the witts out of you, but today's movie technology is even scarier. For me I like the old sc-fi, simlpe and fun to watch all over again. See you in the future.","2210":"This has to be the best time travel movie I ever seen.  None other comes close.  I like the scene where there is a flat screen tv in the background when the time traveler comes to 1966 and a little girl drops her Woody Woodpecker doll.  Great plot and an all out great movie!","2211":"\"The Time Machine\" is an all-time favorite of ours.  Ranks up top with \"Forbidden Planet\" and \"The Thing (original)\"  Please note that on Instant Video the co-star Yvette Mimieux is not credited correctly...they have another Yvette listed.","2212":"EXCELLENT !  A MUST HAVE ...  THE NEW REMAKES SRE NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS.  TIME MACHINE IS TRULY AN ORIGINAL AND DONE QUITE WELL.","2213":"The movie was bought for my English class to watch after they read the book. They were a little skeptical because it was filmed a while ago, but they ended up enjoying it. The DVD was in great condition.","2214":"Really a great buy at this price. Don't be fooled into thinking this is another 'B' Sci-Fi movie. This is really well done, with fine special effects, and good acting. No, it's not Jimmy Stewart and Betty Davis quality, but what is?  This is the iconic 'Time Machine' movie. The one all the others hope to be.","2215":"I have been looking for this original H. G. Wells classic with Rod Taylor and Alan Young for quite a while. Watched it as soon as it arrived and I wasn't disappointed!! It's a great film, I would recommend it to everyone.","2216":"In addition to an all-time excellent movie, this edition supplies interviews with the cast and those who worked on the film with them. A very touching scene is played out between Rod Taylor and Alan Ladd, reprising their roles in the movie. This is too good of a deal to pass up. Glad I bought mine!","2217":"The movie is one of the all time Sci-Fi classics. By today's special effects standards, it doesn't hold a candle, but that really doesn't make any difference because the story is timeless and for the time it was made, the effects are pretty impressive. I remember seeing The Time Machine in the theater as a kid and I've watched it many times since then. When I saw that I could own a NEW DVD of the movie I jumped at the chance. Especially interesting and entertaining is the \"new\" scene they've put into the special features.","2218":"Good movie in spite of the hokey special effects.  But, considering what they had to work with, it is very good.","2219":"Remake of the original classic is a classic in itself.  Great fantasy movie... great acting by all.  A must own movie!","2220":"One's imaginagion can not help but be stirred after viewing this timeless masterpiece.  If you're looking for a pleasant hour-plus of sci-fi type entertainment then this one is for you.  Enjoy!","2221":"A great movie.  My family has watched it several times, and never get tired of it.","2222":"The movie is a timeless classic, just as I remembered from the first time I watched it a long, long time ago.","2223":"Just re-watched this movie this weekend and forgot how good it was. Alan Young plays Taylor's best friend and there are great behind-the-scenes stories for this movie in Young's book MISTER ED AND ME (I believe that is the title) also available on Amazon.com. If you love Morlocks, beautiful women, Oscar winning special effects and clever plots, this movie is for you.","2224":"This really is a great movie in about every way.  It's well written & acted.  It has forsight. It's fun.  There are slow parts for people who can't appreciate the story and\/or have a short attention span.  I have a hard time bringing myself to spend the time to re-watch it when I'm in the mood but when I do, I'm always glad I did.  I don't think any DVD collection is complete without this awesome classic.","2225":"The Time Machine is not only a wonderful movie but it is a favorite subject of mine; the ability to move back or forth through millions of years fascinates me, especially the future as it is largely unknown. For its age the film is scarcely dated with fine acting and production values, and one of those that you can watch over and over. The question of what to bring with you into another civilization for better or worse is infinitely intriguing.","2226":"I was very pleased with thr DVD \"The Time Machine\", mailed to me recently. It was in excellent condition and met my expectations. Thank you.","2227":"Its the greatest, like you saw it the first time. It hasn't changed, maybe it has change a bit. LOOK OUT PAST, HERE COMES THE BEST!!","2228":"The movie is still as great as when it first came out years ago. The service was quick.","2229":"I saw this movie when I was a kid and it stood with me ever since. I just love the film, the machine and the overall plot. It just keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know more as the movie unfold. The simple but yet clear scientifical explanation early on in the film is a great suspense setter. Overall: EXCELLENT.","2230":"Based on the famous novel of H. G. Wells, a young inventor constructs a device that  enables him to travel to the future, to see what the future will depart us. But this somber gaze has nothing to do with a promissory future where harmony and peace will reign.  Regardless the spanning years, the film still strike you. Memorable special effects and imaginative stages, where the vigorous profile of Rod Taylor is admirably compensated with that sidereal beauty who Yvette Mimieux was.  Georges Pal would eventually the same director of the famous cult movie:\"the seven faces of Dr. Lao.\"","2231":"Great movie about a man who travels through time into the future, and then finds his lover who is absolutley beautiful in the year 800,000. Buy this one, it's a classic","2232":"WHERE IS THE BLU-RAY ALREADY?!? HOW LONG MUST WE WAIT?!? WOULD BE AN INSTANT BUY FOR SOOO MANY?!? C'MON HOLLYWOOD!!!","2233":"I've loved this movie forever and now that's it restored, I love it more. I bought the two together to show my kids.  Wonderful film.","2234":"I have watched this many times over the years since I was a kid and it never fails to enthral.","2235":"This is a good fantasy movie. Rod Taylor is terrific in his role as is Yvette Mimeux. If you want action and adventure, this is the movie for you.","2236":"THIS IS ONE OF H.G. WELLS CLASSICS. I SAW IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. IT'S JUST AS GOOD NOW AS IT WAS THEN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.","2237":"Several 3rd grade classes in my school viewed this movie (rated G)after reading a version of the book.  We'd read it chapter by chapter and reviewed with EOG-style questions.  Wow-talk about a page-turner!  The children could not wait to read the next chapter just as soon as we finished the last.  Watching the movie was a fun way to see the images we'd created in our minds come to life.  This was the original version (I think the best) and because it is rated G, I felt very comfortable showing it to my students.","2238":"The Time Machine is a \"deep thought\" movie. This has always been a favorite of mine. I have watched it many times.","2239":"The time machine was an excellent movie.  I highly recommend it.  Rod Taylor is a superb actor, and makes this movie a classic.","2240":"Another trip back in time (sorry about that) for a fine movie.  There's someting in all of us that we would love to escape and go back to simpler times.  Back To The Future was also a trip to a more innocent era that I miss.  What ever happened to Mayberry?","2241":"This was written so so long ago and to think they had a vivid imagination! If they could apply what they did with rise of the planet of the apes with the morlocks or even pass this to christopher nolan! It would hit huge!","2242":"This is a great anniversary edition of this sci-fi classic, however, the seller failed to do a quality check before shipping. The case was damaged inside and a piece of the plastic was rubbing on the recorded side od the DVD making scratches all over. The quality of the video was then, of course, damaged also. Lesson: check before you ship. I'll reorder it, probably from a different supplier.","2243":"I love the old movies of the past, and this one is at top of my list. The quality of picture, sound and color is beyond my best hopes. I feel sorry for the people who give this on less than five stars, if there were ten, i would give them.","2244":"this is a great movie classic.  good suspence and even the graphics are great for the time period.  this is movie that you could watch over and over","2245":"this is a great little movie, one you can watch over and over again. thats what I plan to do.","2246":"Great 60's Sci-Fi movie!  Saw this in the movies with my dad when it 1st came out and have it on DVD.  Just wish it was offered in Blu-Ray.  I'd snap it up in a second.","2247":"I have enjoyed watching this movie ever since it came out. First time was in black and white. Makes one think about how things could turn out.","2248":"Although this movie was made in 1960, it will hold you attention. It is exciting at how the author imagined what thousands of years into the future might look like! Enjoy!","2249":"This is a great movie & has been updated considerably (visually) over the original. The quality of the image is much better & more clear. It's the same original movie but even more enjoyable to watch now. The DVD I received is perfect quality for a used movie. I highly recommend used movies from Amazon. They are great to replace older movies on VCR tape. The prices are very good.","2250":"Classic telling of H.G. Wells's masterpiece. I would recommened this product to any fan of classic sci-fi. I do like the recent rendition, but will never beat the classic.","2251":"This show is still one of the best movies I have ever enjoyed,top 5,(the book is great too),it is a true classic and a fantastic story!! I saw it at the old Avalon theater in Chicago,when it first came out,it was out of sight then & it still is.Good old memories.Enjoy it.","2252":"Rod Taylor builds a time machine and travels forward in time, seeing vast social change, war, and eventually winding up tens of thousands of years in the future. He finds himself in a devolved world, where humans (the eloi) are mere cattle, living in ignorant bliss. They are food for the race of subterranean mutants (morlocks) that lord over them. Can Taylor's character help these doomed folks? Classic stuff!...","2253":"One of George Pal's greatest films.  Rod Taylor travels through time to try to find a utopian world of peace and love.  Yvette Mimieux makes Marilyn Monroe look ugly. Great fun and adventure.","2254":"Really Great to see this clasic again. Arrived in good time, no defects and good condition. thank you","2255":"Rod Taylor is at his best in the HG Wells Classic.  Good film and the storyline is very close to the novel.  I wished that they would have made Time Machine II.  They had a script for the film but was never produced.  This one is better than the one that was remade in 2002.","2256":"This is a great movie for anyone that enjoys old movies.  Not to mention Arlene Dahl is just beautiful!","2257":"Excellent acting by Taylor, Young, Cabot, and Mimieux (sp?). Good sets and fine (if now outdated story). To reviewer Michael Butts. Giant was directed by George Stevens, not George Pal.","2258":"filby plays a good role in this film","2259":"I enjoy viewing movies that I remember as a child. These movies are clean cut. The movie in dvd format had great quality.","2260":"THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC FROM THE SIXTIES. GOOD ACTION, WELL MADE, THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE","2261":"Super fast delivery! Love this movie.  my only pet peeve is that the dvd was loose in the case due to rough handling while in shipment...but no scratches no worries!","2262":"Unlike the recent re-make this flows more of the book diologe....   I give it good acting credit, Alough I think it does kinda lack the classic touch but it was the good classic tech (not the best but good) Ide suggest renting it, buy it if you relly like it!.","2263":"The DVD is excellent.  DVD was received in excellent condition and before expected delivery date.","2264":"My title says it all.I don't care if I'm from The Matrix and Star Wars generation,I loved this movie alot more then the 2002 remake.I think George Pal was the Steven Spielberg of his time.It's a great masterpiece,Rod Taylor was perfect as the time travller and it was a total blast watching him go forward in time.In the remake it was a total of 10 minutes of him going though time and in the orgainal,it's about half and hour.So to the people of my generation,skip the remake and watch the Pal classic instead. ***** out of *****","2265":"A good movie for it's time and a good movie now. So much better than the cheesy remake.","2266":"Good special effects for the time it was produced. Kind of a melancholy story but well worth watching. In many ways better than the more recent interpretation of the novel.","2267":"H.G.Welles Time Machine is a great Sci-Fi film that everyone must see. Perhaps the special effects are a bit dated,but ahead of it's time when made. Its' theme speaks to the path of destruction that man has taken on its march through time. Thanks to Amazon for pricing this movie so we can all enjoy its message.Good luck to the Eloi.","2268":"What a great movie. Rod Taylor Takes HG Well's George the main charactor through time. He tries to find a better world. Yet as far as you  can go things remain the same. The special effects for the 60's was great. HG Wells was showing how he felt about society. Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks. Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book. This movie was charming, exciting and a true classic. See it.","2269":"A thousand times better than the recent remake.  Don't bother with that one. This is the definitive movie.  I watched this with my 22 year old daughter who is studying animation.  She agreed with me that George Pal's 1960 animation was as good as anything in the new version.  The story was far better presented. and the additional 30 minute special feature with brings Rod Taylor and Alan Young back together again 30+ years later was far more enjoyable than most 'making of' features.","2270":"I've always loved this movie from the time I was a kid.  One funny thing I noticed that I never noticed before is in the underworld fight scene.  Just before the Eloi start heading up from the Morlock's underworld area, watch the dead Morlock in the sitting position.  He moves his leg out of the way so the Eloi can run past him.  What a considerate corpse.","2271":"I have been searching for this very version of this title for quite a long time. I owe the newer version of this film & I find it to be a very Poor remake of a very great Classic movie.","2272":"This time travelling tale  is getting quite old, but is still fine  entertainment that will stir the imagination. Saw this movie around 40  years ago and even if some stuff is outdated, it still holds my attention.","2273":"The Time Machine is a classic, period.  I will not go into the details of the movie as many other reviewers have already done so (great good vs. evil).  Warner Brothers came out with the stellar Ultimate Forbidden Planet, complete with a model of the robot and tin box!  How cool would it be to have the same for the Time Machine (like maybe, a model of the time machine???)  These two movies (in Ultimate editions) are the best bookends your DVD library could ever have.","2274":"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid, and have watched it at least thirty times since, it had a great impact on my life. The special effects leave a little to be desired, compared to a 'modern' flick, but it's a classic that belongs in everyone's movie library.","2275":"I can't say enough about this film version of H.G. Wells' &quot;Time Machine,&quot; as opposed to the newly remade version with Guy Pearce (which I don't recommend, by the way).  Rod Taylor makes for the PERFECT lead character: he has class, presence, and charm unlike many of the young actors today.  While the special effects leave much to be desired, it's still a wonderful movie that will not disappoint.  A great movie for fans of romance, time-travel, and science fiction.  This is HIGHLY recommended!","2276":"This is still the classic movie - saw it as a pre-teen and loved it then and it still brings back memories - the newer version does not compare with this classic - would not recomend it for small children","2277":"Beautiful conversion of a clean film to DVD, nicely presented, well organized, lots of interesting background information.","2278":"I definitely recommend this movie!!! It has a good story line from the beginning to the end... you will not be disappointed!!!","2279":"Maybe it's because I think of this version as the standard against which all other Time Machine movies must be compared. I just enjoy it.  It was a great introduction to the idea of relativity for my 8th graders.  They really got into it.","2280":"The Time Machine (1960)was an excellent five star movie produced by George Pal starring Rod Taylor. This old movie has held up pretty well with the passage of much time.  I first saw it at the Loews Paradise in the Bronx back in 1960. Many of my old friends from the neighborhood took the trek up to Fordham Road to see this movie with me and were not dissapointed with this great film. Although the special effects are a little dated they are nevertheless still effective.  The movie owes much of its success to the original Wells story.","2281":"This is one of the best movies ever made. This isn't just a classic, this movie is one of the movies that paved the way for other sci fi movies. This is as much of a classic as Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind and in my opinion this is better than both of those movies put together.","2282":"The Time Machine is a true classic film that is an adventure in time, past present and future. I highly recommend it!","2283":"An absolutely brilliant exposition of HG Wells famous novel.It really does explain what time is,and is very educative for budding students of Physics ! The sets are very well laid out ,the acting brilliant.It certainly adheres to the plot much better than the 2002 version and I would recommend it strongly to all those who are interested in Sci Fi and the subject of time travel","2284":"Very interesting and well done.  Really enjoyed the story, acting and cinematography.","2285":"I was glad to find this version still available.  I enjoyed this because with our technology expanding so rapidly in today's world, time travel appears to not only be possible but probable; maybe in another 100 years.  I wish it were possible now.  This version is truer to the book than the newer version recently produced.  What would you take with you into the future?","2286":"Dances with wolves meets Shogun, with a little Braveheart thrown in (When you see the final battle scene in the movie, and have already seen Braveheart, you'll see what I mean)....but done real well. (Thank god!) Makes me want to be a samurai just watching it. If you have any interst in Japanese History or culture I highly recomend it.","2287":"I agree with most of the other reviewers. This movie is an excellent, touching, and soon to be classic movie. Tom Cruise is simply Tom Cruise as always. He might not win the Oscar, but who needs Oscar when other actors go for Oscar to become as famous as Tom. The director does a good job, and this is one of the rare movies of 2003 that makes sense unlike Matrix or Terminator sequels. I recommend this one as a resolution for '04!","2288":"Great battle scenes never seen in this scale. Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise was superb.","2289":"I'm gonna review the quality of the blu-ray version of this movie. I'm not gonna review the movie itself as there are enough reviews of it. The image quality is totally HD quality, image is crisp and detailed and the audio is superb. I'm not a fan of special features so I can't tell you if there are enough as I normally don't watch them unless there are deleted scenes or alternate endings. If you like this movie and you have an hdtv then this is a good purchase.","2290":"I feel thsi is a better moive than Lord of the rings the  Return of the king, the best movie i have ever seen. and , The music is fantastic, the acting excelent, i cant wait to watch this movie at home in my  70 inches  widescreen HDTV , and my Home theater...!!!!","2291":"Way better than Lord of the Rings. The battle sequences were suberb and stunning. I loved the fighting and plot. Tom Cruise was awesome in acting in this movie. It was also historicly accurate. So you can learn from this film. It was very educational. It deserves some academy awards. If you like movies like Gladiator you'd pamper yourself by coming to this movie","2292":"Last Samurai is no masterpiece  but technically it is  the visuals, the sound effects, the music.  If you want to show off to your friends what a great hi-def system you got, purchase this movie.  If you want a classic, but lord of the rings or gone with the wind instead.","2293":"Frankly i purchased this item just to know how a BD differ from a DVD on my HDTV using my newly purchased PS3. i chose this product cause it has a lot of natural & colorful scenes. the result was really amazing, visualy, blu-ray movies really surpasses DVD. i couldnt test the audio difference, cuz i only have 5.1 Sony decoder. the movie per say is a must see for all those who like action titles.","2294":"Tom Cruise's character comes off as a man who has seen violence from the time the doctor slapped his butt. War does things to soldiers that nobody else can understand or comprehend. The music is impressive, especially before the large battle. I feel goosebumps everytime I watch it. From the Cruise\/Samurai entrance to the emperor receiving the sword.  Go for it.","2295":"I thought &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; was an excellent movie.  I plan on keeping this DVD handy.  I have little doubt that I will watch this one many, many times.","2296":"You may think I am joking but Honestly, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I have found so many movies so boring of late that I just doze off during the performance. This movie tells a good story with well paced action scenes. Beautifully photographed and with a very nice music score throughout.","2297":"Beautifully filmed with a plot that truly touches the heart. The cast chosen were oerfect and the theme was good. No regrets! Wating for the DVD to be released. A sure buy thing. I wanted to go watch it the 3rd time.","2298":"This movie is a thing of beauty, with the substance to match its style. A stunning spectacle of cultural violence and a loving tribute to the great Japanese samurai.","2299":"The Last Samurai is a great movie, good story, very entertaining.  I'd recommend seeing this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD if you haven't seen it yet.<p>This movie is not a study in phenomenology and existential philosophy, but a good movie that made tears come to my eyes and that doesn't happen too often.<p>I thought this movie was better than the Lord of the Rings, though I'd guess that that comes from actually reading the books.","2300":"This film is a must see!!!  Tom reaches deep down for the emotions expressed in this film.  You feel every ounce of his anguish and regret for the terrible things he's done in his war days. I agree with the critics (something I rearely do...) when they say this film is of epic porportions.....  This film moved me very deeply, but it also had a touch of humor here and there..just enough. I can't wait until it's released so I can see it again!!!!","2301":"This is a pretty enjoyable movie with a good amount of Japanese history in it. It's not entirely accurate, but it is still a good film nonetheless, and Tom Cruise does a good job in his role. The setting of Japan is also done well as well as its Westernization as Japanese citizens either embrace it or fight against it. Overall a good historical film.","2302":"This movie is one of my favorites very entertaining. I wanted a personal copy so that I could turn on the subtitles and be able to follow along during the Japanese dialog.","2303":"This movie is amazing.  I have it on DVD, but the Blue-Ray is so much better.  All the action scenes look so real, almost like you are there.  Highly recommend.","2304":"My favorite element of this movie is Tom Cruise as modern man finding Solace in the ancient ways of Japan.  It is a powerful analogy which explores what it means to be succesful in society and what it means to be a modern man.  Something I often wonder about while thinking of my legacy.","2305":"This epic film has to be one of Tom Cruise's best efforts. The story is not about war, instead it is about the culture, spirit and way of the Samurai. It was such a disappointment that this film did not get the recognition it deserved. Ken Watanabe's performance was simply outstanding. Tom Cruise put his heart and soul into this film. He is such a powerful actor!","2306":"Terrific action-packed movie.  No dull moments here.  Tom Cruise plays a misplaced American soldier hired to help transform Japan's feudal military into a modern Western one.  In the process he is captured in battle and exposed to the samurai way of life which he ultimately embraces.  An intriguing look into this arcane culture.  Director Edward Zwick's cinematic direction and Hans Zimmer's scoring makes \"The Last Samurai\" appealing on so many different levels.  But it's Ken Watanabe's razor-sharp performance and Koyuki's stunning elegance that steal the show.  A definite 5-star entertainment film.","2307":"Don&#8217;t have to say much here. This is an action film in the no-tongue-in-check, classic sense, of films like &#8220;In the Line of Fire,&#8221; &#8220;Rob Roy,&#8221; and so on, a true action film. Absolutely worth watching and owning. It is one of Cruise&#8217;s best performances. I just wish there were more films like this. Empowering.  -- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)","2308":"I have never been a Tom Cruise fan.....until now! The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it is by far Tom Cruise's best role. Also adding to the film's greatness is the performance by KEN WATANABE as Katsumoto.  He is an incredible actor!!!  To put it simply.....you do not want this film to end.  It is one that you will want to watch over and over again.","2309":"This is a movie that is great and which exceeds beyond movie limits. It has action, a great plot, and great actors. 10 stars for this movie!","2310":"Now this is what I like.Courage...Honor...respect...Fighting for a cause not just some measly paycheck that is not worth the soul it is printed on. Real values. It is ashame that Honor is not taken more seriously by anyone other than old Japanese warriors. Because It is the only thing that defines a man, not his purse.","2311":"I was very impressed by this film. The characters portrayed much emotion and realism. The ending was quite emotional too. This is one of the rare films that the would be bad guys are actually good. I was very touched. The extras on the second disc were pretty good, I liked the history of the film and the era which it takes place. I rented, I saw, I bought. Enough said. MF","2312":"Let me just say that this movie could have so easily been a horrible romance flick.  They could have had trashy love scenes and cheesy personal moments.<p>I believe that they handled the material and relationships between actors WONDERFULLY.<p>Additionally, this movie had quite a few accurate historical moments and weapons.<p>I highly recommend this flick.","2313":"I did not consider myself as a Tom Cruise fan, that is until I bought this DVD and sat through it three times in two days. There is a terrific sound track that compliments the phenomenal camera work and first class acting by all the cast. The battle scenes and the fights are so good I found them spell binding. Special effects were brilliant. The suppressed emotion between Algren and Taka which turns from hate to love was beautifully done. When the Samurai hero dies he says &quot;Perfect&quot;. A suitable label for this production. I thoroughly reccommend it.","2314":"I love Drama\/Epic movies, but The Last Samurai blew me away. It is the best movie in a couple of years. I loved the Acting, Cast and of course the whole place where it was shot.  The settings were beautiful.  I recommend this movie to everyone, awesome movie. I would give it 10 stars if there would be 10 stars. The only movie I can compare this to is Braveheart, but even that one didn't move me as much as The Last Samurai. Buy it now and never get rid of it!!","2315":"Have seen this pic in cinema here ireland thought it was pretty damn good cruise pulled off this one very well -only thing to disapoint was on battle field riding back to the samuri troops ,think too many films of this nature are doing that braveheart battle scence , but overall that this was a pretty good film had me on edge of seat at times troughly recomend to watch or buy (...).","2316":"I thought the movie was good, and the japanese were very authentic. But it is impossible for tom cruise to become a samurai, unless the emperor made an ammendment to the laws passed down for centuries, which of course never happened. The movie is good with a plot, but as I said, the producers didn't think of how historically accurate this movie was. The overall movie had a plot and was very well made, and it seems like they put in a lot of time for every scene, just to make you feel immerssed in the culture. Good movie.","2317":"As a man who loves Kurawowa and other films of this genre, when I saw Tom Cruise was making this, I thought, \"You have got to be kidding.......\" Then I saw parts of his Oprah stint and said, \"Plllleeeease.\"<p>Once again I underestimated Tom.  Sorry about that TC.  <p>The film was magnificent.  I would have to say it is Oscar worthy, but those dumbasses who do the judging do not know anything about foreign films.  Crouching Tiger deserved best pic darn it!!!!<p> I cannot believe The Last Samurai was not nominated for best picture.","2318":"The Last Samurai is entertaining. I got involved with the characters and wanted everything to turn out well. The action sequences are well done. The acting is well done.<p>However, The plot is formula. The ending, while throwing in a twist or two is still predictable. The moral theme has been done to the hilt.<p>In Short, This is a good movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend a lot of money to add it to my collection.","2319":"By far this is the best movie that I've seen in a long while.  Not only does it depict strong issues about honor, trust, integrity, values, sound morals, lodyalt, duty, and respect, but it also shows a deeper sense of love and loving than I've seen ages.  Here is a movie full of passionate love, but no blatant sex acts.  Yeah!!!  That was a wonderful departure from the norm.  Ken Watunabe's role was AWESOME!!!  This is a great movie.","2320":"I was bored one Sunday evening and happen to catch this on TV.  I really had no anticipation that it would be a good movie.  I was wrong.  It has a full spectrum of emotions running through it.  Tom Cruze is not my favorite actor but he was suburb in this movie.  I immediately bought it from Amazon on Blue Ray.  Highly recommend it.","2321":"I had owned this dvd and watched it many times! This is a cinematic spectacle with lush cinematography and action, as well as a fantastic storyline! I wanted to watch it one day and could not find it! I literally went right to amazon.com and ordered it and am happy I did. It definately makes my top 25 films of all time in a collection of over 7000 titles! Go out and get this movie if you have not seen it. You'll be glad you did! Michael","2322":"This is one of the best action movies since interview with the vampire. Don't know how anyone can rate it less than 5 stars. Great drama\/action. :)","2323":"THE LAST SAMURAI doesn't stand up to anything by Kurosawa, but it did prove that Tom Cruise could act, and it is a very watchable film. For one thing, Ken Watanabe, and Koyuki were simply superb, the cinematography, costuming, battle scenes, and music were glorious, and despite the highly fictionalized portrayal of samurai in this period of Japan's history it is a great story, with memorable characters, and one of the most sensual 'dress' sequences ever.","2324":"If you are interested in Japanese history\/culture such as Samurai, you will obviously like any Samurai related movie.  This is not just any Samurai related movie, Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast make this movie a must see if you haven't already seen it, and a must buy for ANYONE'S DVD collection!","2325":"This is Tom Cruise at his greatest. The film's tone, mood, action, acting, directing, sets, and scenes (especially the exteriors) were magnificent!!! This is a movie with a heart, and Tom's gradual transformation--from savage soldier to honorable fighter--was refreshing and uplifting. Buy it and keep it. You'll want to see it many times, as each viewing shows you how very much more there is than when you saw it earlier. I can't praise this movie enough, and believe me, I'm a harsh critic, especially when I note something unbelievable and phony. Enjoy!","2326":"Excellent movie...........I highly recommend anyone who has not seen this movie should see it asap.  You will want to watch this movie more than once.","2327":"I really enjoyed it. I love historical movies of any kind and although this was a somewhat romanticized view of the historical events that occured, i still thought it was a very good film. I also bought the soundtrack-it was excellent.","2328":"I cannot say enough about this movie. A lot of people were turned off before they even saw it because Tom Cruise plays a samurai. I say their loss. This was a fantastic story about a man whose past haunts him. He plays an American soldier who is captured by the enemy whose culture he is supposed to be helping destroy and the experience changes his life forever. The story was fantastic, the scenery was gorgeous, the costumes were exquisite, the acting was phenomenal. This movie is definitely on my 10 best of 2004.","2329":"I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it-- action, drama, history, it had it all. Tom Cruise was excellent, oscar worthy in my opinion, but the costars also gave powerful performances. I am buying this movie on DVD when it is released!","2330":"Ive never been much of a Tom Cruise fan untill i went to see this film. What can i say but an all action film just brilliant tom should win an oscar.","2331":"A drunken Civil War hero, Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) was assigned to train Japanese soldiers in 1876. \"The Last Samurai\" is a film about honor. Algren went from being a drunken fool to a hero on the battlefield. Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) took Algren captive and began to teach him the code. The movie is excellent.","2332":"The movie was a solid B.  For a movie that Tom Cruise doeesn't have sex with the female lead, it was entertaining.  Disappointing how the movie ended, but that's real life...historically.  The way of the sword...some of that was captured in the film...what's life without honor?","2333":"I keep getting drawn back to this. I believe that this is Tom Cruise best movie. His acting was very good, but I think the story, and more importantly the exposure to Martial Arts values is what makes this film. Having studied many years under a true Korean Master, the \"DO\" way of life is the most important thing I have learned. This movie gives a glimpse of that.","2334":"This is an excellent movie, and the blu-ray edition does it justice. The picture quality is amazing, bright colors, infifnite detail, consistent three dimensionality. This is a must own for blu-ray fans.","2335":"Is this what we were all waiting for??  YES!!!  Incredible image. Crisp. Rich. Full of detail. Incredible contrast. Amazing colors. This is exactly what HDTV is all about.  HD-DVD really got me. I was once a Blu-ray supporter, but now I've got to admit. HD-DVD is simply doing what it was suposed to do: DELIVER!  This HD-DVD have all the extras we find on the regular DVD. How great can it get? Shame on Blu-ray!  Just give me more HD-DVD movies! I can't get enough of it.","2336":"Well worth the purchase if you're a fan of the movie.  The second dvd has loads of nice extras, too.  If you have a large screen tv, defintely get the widescreen version.","2337":"I love this movie!!! I saw it in theaters and loved every second of it. It is the reason that I love Japan and Samurai. What I like most about it isn't just the cinematics but the moral behind it. Honor...","2338":"This is a great movie, their is nothing more to say. Why has Tom not won an Academy Award yet? You would figure after Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Days of Thunder,Vanilla Sky, well you get the picture.","2339":"I really enjoyed this movie. Thank goodness, there wasn't any unnecessary sex scenes which seem to be in most movies these days. This movie has action\/adventure and yet has at least one scene which has brought a tear to everyone I know that's seen this movie.  In a nutshell, this movie shows what respect is all about!","2340":"American guy coes to Japan to ttain Japense soilders to fight th rebilain, but he goes to the rebliain villaige and finds out there peaceful way of living. Later, of course, he becomes a samurai. This is cool film. Really liked pretty Japanse actress, the big fight, and the fact that it is Japan( Every thing good comes from Japan). This is a cool film. You'll like it.","2341":"Amazing story, great cinematography.  For how ling this movie is, it's over way too fast.  Amazon streaming does a fantastic job, never had a buffering issue.","2342":"Lots of action and a gripping plot made this movie seem shorter than it's actual run time of 2 1\/2 hours. As usual, Amazon was speedy with their delivery.","2343":"Could almost be a documentary I am half Japanese and this is a very good movie People should get this movie to learn a little bit about the feudal days of Japan","2344":"Brand new, perfect condition, good price, fast delivery.  This movie is a great story and reminds me that Tom Cruise can be way more the a Top Gun or Mission Impossible kind of guy.","2345":"Loved this movie! Very insightful and very well written. Watching the samurai and learning about their values  and the culture was really inspiring. I will definitely watch it again!","2346":"I really am so glad that I ordered this DVD.  Fast shipping got it to me quickly.  I really have enjoyed the story and the beauty of the movie.  I hope that others will see and enjoy this DVD as much as I have.","2347":"This was a great movie not because of Tom Cruise...but because Ken Watanabe steals the movie.  He is fantastic in this film and is an exceptional actor.  He makes the movie worth watching.  The scene at the end is beautifully played by Watanabe and a tearjerker.  If it wasn't for Cruise and his one dimensional acting, this movie could have been superb.","2348":"This is an amazing movie especially after watching the special features afterward. The collection of Japanese actors and their intense desire to be a part of this film... Visually beautiful with an insite to the Japanese culture. Very entertaining on several levels.","2349":"This movie  was Phenomenal  the storyline surpassed my expectations.  The last Samurai is a great story The acting is great I believe this is one of if not the best Tom cruise film... If you enjoy stories about the Samurai or martial arts this movie is definitely for you...I originally thought how in the world could A movie Titled The Last Samurai Star Tom cruise,He's not Japanese?  but But i was blown away by how great this movie was and had to get it on Blu-ray disk","2350":"The beauty and emotion of this portrayal of two very different worlds coming together was well done. I'm brought to tears every time I watch it. The soundtrack is consuming and hypnotic.","2351":"Received shipment sooner than the anticipated timeline provided. Arrived in excellent condition and the quality was fantastic.","2352":"Excellent movie!! I loved it!! Samurai are cool!! This movie is a glimpse into the history of the Samurai Warrior, and his way of life. I recommend it to anyone interested in this subject.","2353":"Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe star in this 2003 war drama. During the Civil War, A Captain meets a Samurai Leader and learns from him. This is a good film and I think it's one of Tom's best. This dvd has nice picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.","2354":"I WANT TO THANK THE SELLER FOR SENDING A GOOD PRODUCT WITH NO DAMAGE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS USED.  IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO ORDER WITH CONFIDENCE.  I WILL USE THIS SELLER AGAIN. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR BEING PICKY ABOUT THE SELLERS THAT YOU ALLOW TO SELL ON YOUR SITE.","2355":"This is a good movie to watch if ur interested in samurais,which was pretty cool. When i bought this it was on sale for 9.99 and i just had to get it because i was skeptic about gettting it before because it was 20-30 bucks before and it wouldnt be worth it, because i could get some better with that money. But for the price i got it for it was a sweet deal and very good movie for those who havent seen it. It is a classic","2356":"My husband watched this movie on tv and wanted to purchase it for his collection.  Well worth the money.","2357":"One of Tom Cruise's best, I wish he made more films like this! Looks great on Blu-ray my Dad loves it! Thanks Amazon.","2358":"This edition is very good. The movie is excellent and look authentic. The extra credits are also a must see and are interesting and informative.","2359":"This movie is probably one of the best movies Tom Cruise has starred in as far as a storyline goes. While it may not be an action movie along the lines of the Mission Impossible series, it is a love story told against the backdrop of feudal Japan. The scenery is gorgeous and it actually has a plot to the story.","2360":"What a great movie the lands japan it's so beautiful in HD Blue Ray great disc.","2361":"Anyways, this product is amazing and the quality is superb, sorry I erased by mistake the rating but the reality is that from the transaction to the delivery was correct.!!!","2362":"Perfect.  Hans Zimmer is a true genius and he has composed here the best score of his career so far. The music transcend the movie and the landscapes are just to-die-for. I own both DVD and Bluray of this film to be able to play it whenever and wherever I want.  True, it's not so historical but never claimed to be. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride offered by a perfect cast.  Nothing to waste here, and that's quite rare so I better mention it!","2363":"The best movie I have seen so far this year, it is absolutely wonderful. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, a must if you like good movies.","2364":"Tom Cruise gives a stellar performance! The historical and cultural backgrounds were perfect. The traditional Samurai sense of honor and respect prevails even through the darkest period in their history. Ken Watanabe did an outstanding job portraying Katsumoto, the strong and honorable leader of the last army of samurai. Holding out and fighting against all odds for what he believes in, honor. The only complaint i have with this movie is that it had to end. The battle scenes were nothing short of miraculous. Finally a movie that gives the samurai all of the credit they deserve! 5 STARS!","2365":"This movie is the awesomest movie ever. I cannot wait to buy my own copy! The only real weak point in the movie was the ending, but that was made up for with the awesome battle sequences and storyline! If you liked this movie i also suggest reading Shogun, on which the movie was based.","2366":"I don't like Tom Cruise but this movie is great. The story is  great","2367":"Truly an excellent movie. Exemplification of the word \"honor\". Well worth watching. You'll walk away from it with a greater vision of life.  By the way, I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but I'll wholeheartedly say he played his role magnificently.","2368":"This is an outstandingly written, directed and acted film with a fascinating subject matter, the Japanese Samurai. The Blu-ray copy is an upgrade from the DVD in sound and picture quality. Bonus Features are excellent. Highly recommend this film.","2369":"I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I can't think of anyone else who could have done as well in this movie.  The additional segments about the making of the movie, Japanese culture, and the Samurai were also very good.","2370":"This movie is in my must see collection. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he plays his part well in this. Truly a must see - especially on a big screen.","2371":"Okay, so I might like Tom Cruise more than your average person, but no one can say this movie was poorly done or that the acting was bad.  EXCELLENT movie!!","2372":"Just a really well done movie. This has it all: an epic scale, a love story, outstanding soundtrack, and fight scenes. Plain greatness.","2373":"I love historical dramas, and this was a really wondrous story. Anyone who loves history will love this film. Tom Cruise was at his height in acting. All the Japanese actors were great. I'm ordering Shogun for the Japanese history.","2374":"Though I'm not a huge fan of Cruise's, his acting's been getting better with age. The Last Samurai is a solid film that shows us cultural clashes between American ideals and Japanese philosophies in a truly enjoyable way. Definitely worth watching!","2375":"This is a movie that is based in ancient japan and shows you the real way of the samurai. It was a time when old japan was being destroyed and the new japan was being born. It gives you a better understanding about that time period in japan. It really was a big part of history for japan. It just a great film.","2376":"Excellent depiction of Japanese culture and the conflict between traditional and modern forces.  Great movie.","2377":"This was a very important part of history that everyone should want to know, also important to see how the western civilization affected nations across the globe.","2378":"I am not necessarily a Tom Cruise fan but I thought he did an outstanding job in this role.  I loved this movie.  It was well cast and written.","2379":"I think that this is a great movie for my collection. I am not only a costumer here but also a Seller, and let me tell you this movie is a keeper no doubt. Great visuals and great story!","2380":"The video\/audio transfer has excellent quality like what I experienced from other WB blu-ray discs in addition to being an enjoyable movie.","2381":"As a teacher of the martial arts and more specifically Bushido. I try to instill a sense of morality in my students. Think what you will about tom Cruise (Love him or hate him) but his character is a good balance to the movie and helps mainstream an otherwise \"foreign film\" even people I know that will not typically watch a martial arts film enjoy this one. Ken  Watanabe is the best as Katsumoto. They couldn't have picked anyone else. The sense of honor is timeless. The blood is minimal for a movie of this genre.","2382":"Ken Watanabe stole this show.  My feelings for Cruise aside, I did enjoy this film though it does bare (story structure-wise) a gross simiarlity to Dances with Wolves.  In fact, had the whole story been about Watanabe's character this could have been a better movie--that and we avoid the whole Brave Heart\/ The Patriot ending.  Overall, you we be entertained.","2383":"Wow. This movie deserves so many awards I can't even think of enough.  This movie was the first movie to make me cry watching it.  This movie had to be the most inspirational movie I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, you have to see it.  Gladiator almost got me into tears at the end, but this movie finally did it.  If you liked Gladiator, you will love this movie, especially if you are interested in Oriental culture.","2384":"This movie has it all. Drama, action, amazing battle scenes - the best I've ever seen.  It's definitely a must see.","2385":"Lots of action....lots of action....and still lots of action!! Good movie with a great storyline!!! Tom Cruise did a wonderful job in this movie....just be warned...there are many scenes of blood and guts...:)","2386":"The way of Samurai is the way of Death.<p>I think Tom Cruise really understood that and he can die happy now.<p>See the film and think about your death - will it be so beautiful and meaningful as the death of Katzumoto?<p>The film: Five stars definitely.","2387":"This is movie is so great. I am really dissappointed that Tom Cruise wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his wonderful acting. He does such a good job to make us feel for his character and care about what happens to him and the samurai. The action is wonderful and there is no unnecessary romantic scenes like it seems many movies do these days. It is such a wonderful movie for the whole family and it's dissappointing to see that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Watch this movie, and if you've already seen it, watch it again!!!","2388":"\"The Last Samurai\" is BY-FAR - without a doubt - THE BEST MOVIE EVER in the history of movie-making! Returns us to the classics! They don't make them like this anymore! A MUST-SEE! AND a MUST-sweep for the Oscars, the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild, and the remainder of the awards season! Tom Cruise (Captain Nathan Algren) gives the best performance of his career! And Ken Watanabe (Lord Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka) give OUTSTANDING supporting performaces! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!! My favorite movie of ALL TIME!","2389":"I rated The Last Samurai 5 stars because it was the best movie i have ever seen. It's got it all mad good action, a little comedy, and some romance. I don't really like romance but with the girl that plays Katsamoto's sister. She is really hot. And I liked the movie so much I went to go see it again. I can't get enuff of it. I am going to see it again. So go see The Last Samurai I garntee you will love it.(.)(.)","2390":"I was able to catch a sneak preview of this movie. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It has action, humor, and lots of emotional moments. I don't have time for details. This is a movie that should not be missed! Forget Master and Commander and Timeline, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!","2391":"When I saw this film at the theaters, I remember enjoying it but not thinking much of it.  Now, years later, I watched it again, and I was so pleasantly surprised. The story is very dramatic, it's beautifully photographed, and the action is breathtaking. The performances across the board are great, including what I consider a career best from Tom Cruise.  It's just really good. If you like historical dramas like Gladiator, Braveheart, or Dances with Wolves, you should really enjoy this. It's definitely in the same league.","2392":"Not 100% FACTUAL but a great movie with a wonderful view of changing cultural upheaval and the clash of traditional with technological","2393":"I love this movie. It is one of the best with Tom cruise. This is one that will watch more than once.","2394":"I owned this movie before & it was stolen from my house. I was determined that I would not buy it again, but it was such a good movie I had to give in. The real reason for this review is the fast dependable service provided by Amazon. I ordered this movie & had it in my mailbox two days later. Thank you Amazon, you never let me down.","2395":"The film itself is great now that i saw it on blu-ray its just amazing.","2396":"My brother thinks of this as one of the best movies ever.  I thought it was pretty good, but I sent it to him for a what the heck gift, and it was worth it to make him happy.","2397":"Well we already know about the movie so i am not going to comment on it. The most noticable thing about this Blu Ray release is the picture quality, its sharp, vivid colors, simply amazing. :) If you are looking for something to run as a demo on your new HDTV, this is the one. :)  I played it on my PS3 in 720p, its just great.","2398":"This movie held my attention all the way through. It has a lot of action, but it was well-paced, believable, and well-intertwined with great drama and cinematography. The similarities this movie has with Dances with Wolves is intellectually stimulating and welcomes thoughtful discussion. I think I will add this DVD to my collection.","2399":"I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I love this film.  I liked the story, the Japanese actors, the costumes and scenery.  I've watched this film several times, and I've cried everytime.","2400":"Music, grandeur, great locales--everything!  Battle scenes are amazing.  Bought fullscreen edition and it fills big screen HDTV with vivid picture.  Extra disc has fascinating stuff.","2401":"Many people say that Tom Cruse is unconvincing or overrated. I am now convinced that these people have seen neither this film or Collateral. This is a heart-felt, pure epic of sorts which are very rare in this day and age. This film follows a sad storyline of fighting for tradition and avoiding judging anyone until you meet them. This movie is filled with breath-taking scenary of the Japanese landscapes, and riveting battle sequences. Films of this caliber are very rare.  *9* (A)","2402":"Very well made movie not sure about the messagge...  I am not a Tom Cruise fan but he did a great job in this movie, I am still not sure if the messagge was anti technology, in that case I would say it is quite shallow.","2403":"After seeing all of the movies nominated for Best Picture 2003, and just watching The Last Samurai last night, I feel that this movie (not to mention its actors)was greatly overlooked by the Academy. Cruise is spectacular as the disillusioned 7th Cavalry Captain who finds his place among Katsumoto's (Ken Watanabe..who should have won an Oscar as well)rebel band of samurai's who are fighting to keep their tradition alive in a time when Japan is looking to become more westernized. This movie has a little bit of something in it for everyone and I highly recommend it...","2404":"I purchased this video for my teenage son. He has watched it several times, and says he would recommend it to anyone that likes these types of movies.","2405":"A very well crafted movie, with so many parallels to the spiritual life, especially the priesthood. I was particularly struck by its romantic view of an idealized lost culture, juxtaposed against modern industry and greedy politicians, which served as a warning against the dangers of Utilitarianism (which pope John Paul II spent so much time speaking out against in his writings).","2406":"One of my all time favorites. Arrived early in great condition. It was wonderful to see it in HD. I have it on DVD but it was a great deal.","2407":"Bargain deal at a great price. Bought it during Black Friday at amazing low price with super saver shipping! Packaging is fine.","2408":"asome!! A must see movie if you love action!! worth watching more then once. hurry and get yours today. My son watched it four times.","2409":"Movie was easy to find online.  It arrived as promised and I'm happy with the order and the way it was processed.  I'll order from this company again.","2410":"I'm happy with the service, especially the package and the protection of this item. The movie have very good quality image and sound. I will recommend to my friend and family","2411":"I always wanted to see this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was a wonderful DVD!!  It arrived in pristine condition.","2412":"Great Quality DVD, clean, no scratches. Came quite quickly. Came with everything as promised and in perfect condition! NO complaints here!","2413":"It was a quick send It was a great product I would buy from againnn","2414":"The last Samurai is a typical movie to watch on Blu Ray. The image during the first 20 minutes of the movie are not impressive, but once Tom is in the samurai village the image quality is beautiful!","2415":"This movie is one of the best movie every time you see it... you learn somthing new.","2416":"Outstanding in every way. I can't think of a movie in recent history that I have enjoyed more.  Great cultural piece.","2417":"Tom C's best movie - I am not a big Tom C. fan but this is his best movie. Good pace, good acting, great soundtrack it has it all -","2418":"I have seen the film in theaters and about a hundred times on DVD. I beleive it to be the very best film on dvd. Ps. HEY DUDE WHO WROTE THAT SAMURAI IS INNCORECT AND BUSHI IS CORRECT IS WRONG, BUSHI WAS THE SAMURAI'S NAME BEFORE THEY WENT INTO SERVICE OF THE EMPEROR, SAMURAI \"TO SERVE\" MEANS TO SERVE THE EMPEROR, READ UP ON YOUR HISTORY BEFORE MAKING SUCH ALIGATIONS.  ANYWAYS best dang movie of all time 5 out of 5.","2419":"'Good enough' is about as good a review I can think of for this movie.  As long as your prepared for the formula ending you should be able to enjoy this movie purely on its solid production merits.  Worth viewing.","2420":"This is a very entertaining movie. good action, good scenery and good story. Not as good as braveheart, but one of the best of 2003. extras are good","2421":"I am not especially a big Tom Cruise fan but this was an EXCEPTIONAL Film.  I can see that a lot of time and effort went into the making of this wonderful film.  This action packed film keeps you on the edge of your seat and will also tear at your heart. It is a must have for all serious film buffs and dvd collectors.  I will watch this film again and again.","2422":"There is a goof during the battle scene with the ninjas: the scene where Cruise is on the ground with a ninja on top of him trying to push him into the sword - the part when the kid (I forget his name) picka up a sword and fights the other ninja. Watch Cruise on the ground. He gets the ninja off of him, and the next time it shows him still on the ground with the ninja on him!","2423":"The guys wrote a lot of good stuff in other reviews and i'm not gonna add any more except my HIGH appreciation and recommendations to this movie. I watched twice in the cinema, and finally i go the DVD and watched it again.<p>To me, this is the best movie for Tom Cruise. And it will be a while till he can do something that is better than this one.<p>Again, This is PERFECT. It deserves the 5 stars without hesitating.<p>regards","2424":"&#65533;The path to enlightenment is littered with the bodies of the ignorant.&#65533;<p>This movie was simply incredible.  The acting second to none, the story moving and flawless, the characters deep and passionate, a must see, again and again.<p>Hired to train the army of a Japan drowning in western influence, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), becomes captured by a band of &#65533;savage&#65533; samurai warriors led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). In the months to come Algren embraces the code of the samurai and befriending his &#65533;savage&#65533; enemies to soon discover there is nothing savage about honor, duty, and respect.","2425":"After reading some of the reviews here, I was not expecting too much from this movie, but thought I would give it a try anyway. I was truly surprised, it was VERY well done, the acting and story line were far more solid then I had expected. This movie delievered far more then I expected. <p>So all I really have to say, is give this movie a try, I doubt you will be disapointed.","2426":"This movie has action, drama, story, great cinematography and good acting. The fight sequences are well choreographed. The story is deep and has soul. It gave me that feel like when I saw dances with wolves and fighting spirit like Gladiator. This movie will bring the Warrior out of you once you get into it!<p>If, like me you love Epics, History, Martial arts and ZEN stuff, You'll enjoy this movie hopefully.","2427":"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times.  I've always like Tom Cruise and he doesn't disappoint in this movie.  But the real star is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader-what perfect casting! And Koyuki as the Samurai widow was just plain gorgeous.  The HD DVD transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better.  Highly recommended.","2428":"I had the privilage of the movie and all i can say that it was amazing. everything from the acting to the set designs was great. The dialogue was very engaging and the fight scenes was out of this world, especially when TOM cruise's character fights Ujia in training. Tom does an excellent job and proves his acting can garner an oscar nomination for a lead role.","2429":"a very enjoyable film with captivating visuals (the filmmakers deserve much credit for filming in actual authentic locations) and powerful, realistic fight scenes.  The story does test one's \"believability standards\" a bit, but in a manner akin to Gladiator and so many others. This is Hollywood. Sit back and give yourself to the movie. There is so much here to enjoy.","2430":"This is the best damn tom cruise ever.I forgot that was tom and believed he was capt.nathan algren.this movie is a masterpiece.forget that review above and watch this instant classic.","2431":"Insomuch as the movie was not designed to be a historical account of what happened during this period in Japan, rather an interesting, beautiful work of fiction in the form of a movie, I liked it.<p>&quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; in Japan?  Definately. Amazing film making?  Umm, yeah, okay. Terrific scenery and costumes?  Oooooh yeaaaaaah.<p>I'm *not* a Tom Cruise fan, but I *did* like this movie.","2432":"I just finished watching this movie and loved it!!!!! just as much as the first time i saw it. In memory of this movie i bought a set of samurai swords because i loved it so much","2433":"This is a Great Movie And i love it.The price for it is cheap so it is a Must Buy!!","2434":"I don't care if he's a little socially quirky (really what actor isn't).  I just loved this movie!  So subtly moving, and the cast was to die for!  Tom cruise is a great actor, love practically all his movies.  This movie was done exceptionally well, well done!","2435":"THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD EXAM OF THE OLD MEETS THE NEW AND EAST MEETS WEST.  ALSO A GOOD EXAM OF THE MAIN CHARAXCTER DEALING WITH HIS OWN PROBLEMS.","2436":"I liked it. The ending wasn't bad. A lot more of the movie was spoken in English than I was expecting. The swordfights are really realistic and graphic. It's something that Jackie Chan wouldn't have even been able to handle. There was a fairly decent number of parallels with Dances with Wolves.","2437":"Forget LOTR. You want an epic that actually delivers, this is it. Best use of ninjas in a serious film ever. Great perfomances by both Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. Ken was robbed at the oscars, heck this whole film was. It should have had several more nominations and taken best picture too. Don'ty miss this one.","2438":"This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves! It's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais!!  Of course, this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves, more warfare, more cool fights and more blood!!! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action, the story is a little predictable but still interesting.  P.S: If you have seen Dances with Wolves then you obviouslly note the differences between this one and Dances, but basically they are the same.  Adios.","2439":"Even with all the negative attention Cruise has been garnering lately it's hard to see why people wouldn't see this film. The movie is romantic and fanciful. It is somewhat ridiculous and over the top but also elegant. The fighting scenes are dead on and actually quite beautiful. By far though the star of this movie is Ken Watanabe. If for no other reason you should see this movie just because Billy Connolly is in it.","2440":"First you must understand I am a huge Tom Cruise fan therefore my review may come off bias, but this is truly a great movie believe me or not! If you are a fan of epic movies (Braveheart,Gladiator, etc) then The Last Samurai is your film, and if you are a fan of the epic genre and Tom Cruise the world can get no better! This film has it all great cast, passionate and exciting storyline, and beautiful cinematography to top it off. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, enjoy!!!","2441":"Great transaction, product in excellent condition as promoted, prompt shipping and extra care taken with bubble wrap inside a padded envelope!  This seller is concerned that you receive product in same condition it was sent!!!  No USPO mail-mashing!","2442":"La version de esta pelicula en bluray es excelente, los colores son mas vividos y el sonido es totalmente superior, es una de mis peliculas favoritas de tom cruise","2443":"One aspect I really like in this movie is it's portrayal of PTSD in Cruise's character. I recommend it to family members of returning war veterans.","2444":"Great performance of Tom cruise...I am not a big fan of him but I just love this movie.","2445":"When I saw it the first time, I said, I must have that one! By this time I've seen it at least 20 times!!!","2446":"i've seen this movie in a total of what, 100 times or somethin'. it's absolutely amazing. tom cruise was awesome. it even got me to shed a few tears when katzumoto's son died. if u haven't seen this yet, ur missin out.","2447":"In short, great film to say the least and the music (Hans Zimmer) is excellent and blends perfectly with the movie.","2448":"Tom Cruise stars in this wildly entertaining prequel to Nick Castle's THE LAST STARFIGHTER.  Miss this and you'll be searching for a sword to fall on.","2449":"A lot of reviewers wax philosophical as they describe their reasons for disliking the movie -- not historically accurate, an offense to the Japanese, an offense to Western culture. I'm pretty well read with friends of all ethnic origins, and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. <p>It's a simple story about a man's struggle to belong and regain his honor through helping others. Tom Cruise did his usual good-quality job, and the rest of the cast was outstanding. The real star of the movie is the allure of a simple life.","2450":"Drunken, war-weary Cruise accepts a mission to train Japanese soldiers but finds the old way more suited to his personal sense of honor. Filled with thrilling battle scenes, fabulous cinematography, and the rich culture of ancient Japan, \"Last Samurai\" delivers on every level. Cruise's background and personal torment are glossed over a bit - this could have been explored more, and his romance with the widow of the warrior he defeats in battle is left unresolved, but this is a great adventure story. Highly recommend!","2451":"Besides the emense amounts of gore *do to violent war scenes* it has beautiful scenery and wonderful messages of love. At first i though that this movie would be a waste of money, but i was very wrong. Even though i hate extreme violence this movie was an exception.","2452":"But never really hooks the viewer. Good action but contrived.","2453":"This is a movie that when it is on TV I will stop to watch it everytime.  Great flic but how is it that when searching for the movie I stumble on a blu-ray copy for 9.99 and VHS for 13.84???????  Did I miss something I know unfortunately that the 80's are coming back but not this much.","2454":"Plain and simple if you like action this movie is for you.  If you like drama this movie is for you.  If you like foriegn this movie is for you.  iTs my favorite move, and Tom Cruise is awsome in this movie.","2455":"The last Samurai was a really good movie. It was about a Captain in the American army that went to Japan to help train men for Japans new army to fight the samurai. The Captain gets captured during a battle and stays and trains with the samurai. In the end he fights for samurai. It is really good watch it.","2456":"EXCELLENT PRODUCT. RECEIVED IN TIMELY MANNER.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOY ACTION MOVIE, CULTURE ,AND ROMANCE.","2457":"Although I have reviewed this movie with heightened interest, are the facts portrayed historicaly valid, and if so, where can I peruse more profound articles on the Internet that depict the Mercenary involvement between the United States and Japan?  I am a Social Studies teacher and would like to share this issue, if a true account, with other teachers in my local area.  Please respond by e-mail at your earliest convenience.  Thank you.","2458":"Although I have reviewed this movie with heightened interest, are the facts portrayed historicaly valid, and if so, where can I peruse more profound articles on the Internet that depict the Mercenary involvement between the United States and Japan?  I am a Social Studies teacher and would like to share this issue, if a true account, with other teachers in my local area.  Please respond by e-mail at your earliest convenience.  Thank you.","2459":"Probably the best original historical movie, EVER.  I would even go as far as saying that it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life.  This is definately a must see, if not a must own.","2460":"I am not a Tom Cruise fan.  In fact I think he is a bit of a nut.  But...after saying that this is a good performance for him.  While the plot is fairly predictable I think it is an interesting look into a historical time period.  A transition from an ancient tradition in Japan into the modern age.  I would recommend the film to anyone who loves history.","2461":"warner made another beautiful HD transfer.  I can't find another wrong, no grain anywhere.  Just a perfect crystal clear image from start to finish.  The cinematography will blow you away.  Would give this 6 stars if i could.  So far I find warner is the only studio willing to give HD addicts the best video quality possible.  Some studios just throw a title on blu-ray and expect us to say, thank you for releasing it.","2462":"A stunning story and modern classic!  Very well told and acted.  The sets were incredible!  The evolution of the main character was played out perfectly, and the story within the story couldn't have been better.  This is a cinematic work of art!","2463":"This is a must have for any Bollywood film collector. The soundtrack alone is worth the investment. The film is also very interesting and should bring a smile to most anyones face.","2464":"THIS WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE, IT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  THE DANCE SCENES WILL FOREVER BE IN MY MIND.  THIS WAS A GREAT BUY.  RECOMMEND HIGHLY.  IT'S LIKE AN OLD BOLLYWOOD FLICK BUT EVEN BETTER.","2465":"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was enjoyable. This story did not leave this viewer with a sense of ending. There should be a second season to bring the story to a conclusion. Maybe there will be, until then, the ending of this series is only available in the manga books. I have not seen the manga story so I can not be sure it has a conclusive ending.","2466":"The only reason this got 4 stars was due to the ending. It left me sort of let down. I found not knowing what happened to the two heroines really hurt the story. I was left wishing that we knew what came next. The plot does lead up to a nice climax but when we get hung out at the end. Other than that this was a really good series.","2467":"After a lifetime of seeing ghost, young Sumire is recruited by powerful Lucia to fight demons! The gifls batttle darkness as members of the Venus. But as they discover why every life is worth saving, they also learn that they carry their own unlocked potential for evil. The Virus rages out of control, but Sumire and Lucia are prepared to give it the beating it truly deserves. Get ready its time for your vaccination.","2468":"This is a sci-fi action with magic thrown in. It has a bit of romance, some teen-angst soul-searching and plenty of other genres blended in well enough not to hinder the story-line and in most cases help develop it. As it is a S.A.V.E. edition I definitely though it was worth the money. I'd call it average to a little above average. Due mostly to violence, I would not recommend it for children, and some situations may not be acceptable to some parents.","2469":"I love Sand Masters and wanted to buy the season in iTunes. Unfortunately it isn't available, and the season on DVD is probably cheaper anyway. If you love the show this is worth picking up.","2470":"It's hard not to give a movie with Louise Brooks 5 stars, but this just isn't her best vehicle. In fact she only has a supporting role. But anything with Louise's smile is worth watching. If you don't own Pandoria's Box get it first, this is masterpiece. Other Louise Brooks are hard to find but can be worth the effort. Beggar's of Life is a point in example. Nut if you have Pandor's Box get this, it's worth it.","2471":"This video is hot! The dancers definitely did their thing and the host \"Fish Patty\" is crazy funny! There are alot of sexy girls in this video!","2472":"I decided I wanted to learn the autoharp. I really liked this tape better than some because it gave you the basic strums you could practice and easily put together. You must practice. The instrument is simple but takes practice to learn but after a few afternoons you will have fun strumming and picking your way thru familiar songs.","2473":"Great product!  I'm still learning to play, but this is the bible for learning to play the keyboard!  Glad it was offered on Amazon.com.  If you want to learn to play, you should try this first!","2474":"I received a bare-bones copy of the movie, a video rental copy with no extras at all. I was disappointed at this. However, the copy was flawless so from that point of view I was satisfied, I LOVE extras on a DVD, they are one of the main advantages over a VHS copy.","2475":"Good plot, like the grittier feel of this installment.  Christian Bale does a good job as John Connor.  Good effects, great sound.","2476":"I got the product very fast, good price and good conditions. In addition, the movie is the best of the best movies. thanks","2477":"I bought this movie for my semester break. I have only seen it once but it was nice having it for my break.","2478":"Terminator Salvation grows on you with each rewatching.  Christain Bale and Sam Worthington is great! Blair is awesome!! \"I see a man\", and it thinks its human.  Skynets virtual lady reveals the inner workings, while the 'it' chooses for itself. All great stuff.  I'd sign on for Christian bale-Arnie number 5, and this time with plasma's in 50 watt range..","2479":"This movie is great, if you liked the other terminator flicks, you'll love this one. They said it was a new type of terminator this time around, and they weren't kidding.","2480":"I really like this movie, although didn't noticed the difference betwen the director's cut and the thretical version. So any way, liked the movie.","2481":"Terminator Salvation is a good re-visit to the past.  Good but not great.  A GREAT re-visit to a bonafide franchise is Die Hard 4.  Director Len Wiseman understood the material and seamlessly generated an explosive next chapter.  This is where Terminator Salvation falls short.  It borrowed too generously from the past and relied too heavily on editing to make it nothing more than a better than o.k. sequel.  Worth a watch but a missed opportunity for sequel greatness.","2482":"I love this movie, It is intense and very action packed. I seen it in theaters and I loved every minute of it.","2483":"I love you terminator. Anyways, crank the surround sound and bass! i cant wait for them to make an installment with the laser sounds because just with the bullets in this one, it sounded amazing, everything!","2484":"I saw this Terminator movie and decided since I have that in my collection I also need to get the original movies especially since Arnold is the original machine. I was really excited at the animated Arnold in Terminator Salvation. It is so true that the movies are just not the same without him.","2485":"This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay!","2486":"REALLY loved this version. Story was more cohesive than the studio suits allowed it to be in the theatrical release. McG is a fine story teller and was made more evident in this director's cut. If there is more coming,will buy that too!  MOON BLOODGOOD IS HOT in this movie!!! Love seeing her on screen.","2487":"Here is one the critics didn't think too much off, but both the wife and I found it enjoyable.  If you have seen the other Terminator movies, this fills in some good information on the series.  It is well acted and has plenty of action and I thought a very good story line.  One mans opinion but I recommend it for all action movie viewers.","2488":"The blueray picture is always better than the DVD and the extra's are nice as well. The movie plot was so-so, but I was entertained throughout and thats what counts.","2489":"If you enjoy movies that special effects have a starring role, you will like this one.  Also I'm a big fan of Christian Bale, so what more can I say?","2490":"but there was this one part that had me laughing, the resistance, cops or whoever had freakin dogs with them to hunt down terminators ... lol ... freaking dogs!","2491":"love the blue ray, it's better than the theater. this is one of the best terminator movies made. Christian Bale brings his usual intensity to the role of John Conner.  well done","2492":"I recently watched this movie and I really enjoyed it.  Having seen the previous three movies, I was skeptical, but it really had good continuity; especially with the first two Terminator movies.  I think they should actually make another movie to continue this story line.  What I didn't like was the way Amazon constantly changed the price and finally bumped up the full screen addition to $24.99.  I went to ebay and bought it brand new for $9.99.  Amazon needs to be more competitive.","2493":"I really enjoyed this movie.  I've seen all the Terminator movies, I don't listen to critic's, I never have. I like what I like.","2494":"Great movie, everything I expected for a continuation of the Terminator story, and then some.  Very well done.  Highly entertaining.  The ONLY flaw is when they introduced Arnold S's terminator model (T101?)... it was clearly computer generated and looked a little fake, but not too bad.  (Humans ARE hard to do in CG, so...)  That aside, this was a GREAT movie.","2495":"Much better than I had heard from others. Just goes to prove that you shouldn't let others opinions influence you. This was a very enjoyable movie.","2496":"This movie was the best movie I have seen in a while.  I will just leave it at that.  The ending you get a very cool surprise.  Can't really explain why it's good but if you like action movies and Terminators then this is the movie for you.","2497":"loved this movie.  this is one of those that'll stay in my collection.  cant wait for the next one.","2498":"I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOVIE RECIEVED THE SHORT END OF THE STICK,ITS MY FAVORITE TERMINATOR MOVIE.GREAT ACTING ,ANTON YELCHIN ,BRICE DALLAS HOWARD,MOON BLOODGOOD,CHRISTIAN BALE,SAM WORTHINGTON,GREAT ACTORS ,,STORY & MCG DID AN AWESOME JOB.I HOPE THEY WILL MAKE ANOTHER ...BUT MOST LIKELY NOT IT TOOK OVER 2 YRS TO COME OUT .SOMETIMES PEOPLE CANT GET OVER THE ORGINAL ,I HOPE MORE PEOPLE SEE THIS MOVIE & RELISE JUST HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS","2499":"Actually, I've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas. The ONLY place I found it (Director's Cut, Digital Copy) was on Amazon.","2500":"I found this movie to be very good, especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future. Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington give excellent performances. The action and special effects are great. The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film. Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately, but they forget that it has always been Skynet's goal to kill Connor, not Reese, and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor's father.","2501":"To give you an idea where I stand with the Terminator franchise, I give T1 and T2 5 stars and T3 3 stars... This film was gritty like the first with a fresh and new direction. This time dealing with the months and years after \"Judgment day\" John Connor is finding the path that will ultimately lead him to save humanity. It easily out shined the 3rd installment and kept on pace with the first 2. An easy 3.5-4 star review..... I can't wait for Mc G's next story arch...","2502":"I'm a big Terminator fan, and I loved this one no less.  Sam Worthington did a great job.  I even thought Christian Bale did a good job.  Seen in many times and will watch it many more.  \"Come with me if you want to live......\"","2503":"Got to me quick and before the scheduled Time.  Okay movie.  Plot is weak.  Action good.","2504":"This was one of the best terminator movie yet, evryone play their part and it was just a sit down and enjoy yorself type moive, I Recommend this movie to anyone that like action pack and hold on to the edge of your set movie.","2505":"I waited till Dec 1 to buy this and it was AWESOME! This movie had all the elements of the Terminator movies, it had the cyborg tracking John, it had the Terminator chase scenes (again and again), it had the fiery Terminator factory end scene, YES!, it had Arnie as the Terminator and he looked very, very close to how he looked in T1\/T2, it had Sarah Connor, the music, the story, the director, it was all pieced together so well and Bale makes it so believable with his angry acting, just awesome. BUY IT!","2506":"many of the old fan hates this movie. I am young fan and like the war of future. terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan. There so much to take advantage of.  If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling.  The moives does have it flaws like john Conner's wound at the end. Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie.","2507":"Don't get fooled by the digital copy claim that is on for this product. It expired in December 2010. Other than that I am happy with it.","2508":"while in the broad view this movie progresses the plot very little it is a solid action movie and covers the plot terrifically. the action isn't over the top and any explosion scenes are executed perfectly without making it over the top. you should probably watch the first three movies to be able to pick up on the plot immediately but you can get only fine if you don't assuming you've seen the first 3 previously","2509":"Excellent movie.  It successfully tied the three previous Terminator movies together with Salvation, all the way from Arnold to Skynet.  Great special effects, too. This is a MUST OWN MOVIE if you own and\/or enjoy ANY of the three previous Terminator's.  The Arnold Terminator was a fantastic surprise when I saw the movie for the first time in the theater. The Arnold-factor alone truly solidifies a bond between all four movies.","2510":"I will be the 1st to say when I saw this in theaters I left with alot of questions. But with the maximum movie mode where McG pops up every now and then and explains things and tells you the thought process for alot of scenes I finally understand how this one fits the other 3. Still I think only the true die hard fans of  the Terminator movies will appreciate  this movie.","2511":"the blu ray is off the hook and is one of the better ones i've seen. the movie itself is not bad at all. i think people were expecting mcg to pull a james cameron but of course that wont happen because hes not james cameron lol. he still gives you an interesting story with good special affects. this is a lot better than what i was expecting so i give it a solid four.","2512":"I liked the movie it goes along with the story and they even brought back the original terminator \"Arnold Schwarzenegger.\" A lot of action and destruction so if your a guy like me which loves vilence then this a good movie to see if you haven't seen it.","2513":"OK, this a must own, I enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy the whole series. Finally we are in the future. The fight is never over.","2514":"Saludos! Para las personas que quedaron decepcionadas con la ultima entrega (me incluyo) de las pel&iacute;culas de terminator llega esta nueva que revive esta gran saga: SALVATION con un excelente argumento y un buen elenco, aparte de traer idiomas en ingles y espa&ntilde;ol.  Andr&eacute;s","2515":"The director's cut is better than the original but did not have as much added back as I would have liked and I personally think the special features would have fitted on the movie disk. This movie could have been better if it had more scenes added back in or at the least more special features.","2516":"I actually liked this movie... Of course im used to seeing Arnold in these series. But, the story line of this movie kept me interested enough to keep watching. It's definitly worth watching!","2517":"If you have liked even one of the Terminators, then you will like this one.  My favorite of them all.","2518":"imagen 5\/5 audio 5\/5 extras 4\/5 los extras no tienen sub esp audio frances ingles sub esp frances ingles","2519":"i love this movie in the teather, but in blue ray is more detailed and with an excelent sound you will centanly enjoy","2520":"This was a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas and I got it for a super price because I pre-ordered it on Amazon as a gift. Thank you Amazon","2521":"Hello !, I received this B-RD in time and not damage, cheers!. Best regards","2522":"I just seen this movie about 4 days ago. Its a really good movie, and honestly the best out of the Terminator series. Definitly a movie worth buying. SO GET IT LOL.","2523":"I'm a Terminator fan and like all the movies and I wasn't disappointed with this one for sure.  It was also at a very reasonable price through Amazon especially since it had just come out on DVD.  I'm happy with my experience.","2524":"Terminator Salvation was predictable and mostly unrealistic.  However, there was a gritty emotional component to the movie and storyline that just worked enabling you to connect to the characters.  As a result, it was a darn good movie.","2525":"great continuation of the Terminator saga.. Salvation should of came right after T2-JD, but at least we have it now! love it, love it!!","2526":"this is a vevy good movie i have wacth it 3 times now. i love it,it keeps you on you feet.","2527":"Good effecs, pour argument, but the movie is not to bat, in list you pass the time, the actor is good very good a refer to Bale (Batman).","2528":"I am a fan of the Terminator saga. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was the best movie of the series. This film is certainly better then part 3. The DVD displays everything you saw in the movie theater. Unfortunately, there are no extra features on this disk. I was disappointed when I couldn't watch any deleted scenes. This product is good for one who just wants to watch the basic movie, but the dvd will not satisfy serious fans.","2529":"This movie was awesome. Great action, characters, and a great story. It never had a dull moment.","2530":"I gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas.  This was what he had asked for.  He's watched it and enjoys it.  Shipping was immediate and the DVD was in perfect working order.  This is the place to buy.  Never a problem.","2531":"the product arrived way before the deadline in perfect condition, I would say NEW or like new.","2532":"Loved this movie. I was expecting the worst but this terminator movie is runner up to the original only.","2533":"A terminator that is not advertise the star of the show ,but really brings the story in a better level than the other terminators . To all of these people Bravo !!! GOOD JOB.","2534":"I thought the movie was decent, but I was very impressed on how fast it arrived after I placed my order.","2535":"THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OKAY HOWEVER, PREVIOUS MOVIES WERE AT ANOTHER LEVEL. MOVIE SEEMED DARKER THAN NEEDED BUT ACTING OFFSET SOME OF IT, WOULD RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO OTHERS.","2536":"This is a terrific movie for a loyal follower of the Terminator Series. Christian Bale does a fantastic job in his role as John Conner. Intense, gripping and hold onto your seat action. Excellent sequel. I do hope he does a second movie as the same character.  One of best things was the delivery of this movie to my home. Ordered it on Friday morning and was watching it the next day! Cudos Amazon!!!","2537":"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he has already watched it 4 times. Looks great on his new bluray player. He said it's even better than watching it in the theater.","2538":"great graphics, good sci fi, our family of 5, 4 of which are male love the terminator movies.","2539":"This movie is nowhere near bad as people say it is. It isn't even near bad period!  Now some may have had different expectations going into it of what it would be, but that's their own fault. The movie is awesome.","2540":"I barely remember the Terminator movies, so the impact was less harmfull on watching terminator salvation. I was'nt really looking for a continuation of the franchise, i just wanted to be entertained.  And that's what this movie does. I found the movie had great effects, good sound and some great robots. The characters in the film were interesting and the acting was decent.  I find it soo weird to see a digitized Arnold near the end...but a must for the movie. A keeper...good to watch multiple times.","2541":"Terminator Salvation is a good action movie, continues the Terminator saga.  Don't go in expecting it to make a lot of sense though.  Just sit back, watch and enjoy.  And as usual in this series, the Terminator is by far the best character and the one you root for.","2542":"great pic that fills the gap, and like the other films has the terminator as the savior","2543":"good movie John Connor (Christian Bale) a little over the top (over dramatic at times), good CGI - loved the bikes.","2544":"Very solid movie, not as good as I thought it would be, but still worth the money. Great visuals, although the sound was average.","2545":"I liked this movie a lot, but I enjoy the TV series much more. It is easier to follow the time-travel elements in the TV series over the movie T-4. I thought it was a great way to weave the transcendent mythos of:  a man\/not man coming to save mankind, dying or humanity as he gives them his heart to do so.","2546":"I was surprised how much I liked this movie considering all the bad reviews. How can anyone complain about it being too dark or grim? It's post nuclear war, helloooo it's not meant to be a happy, family type of film. Very good sci-fi flick, cant wait for the blu ray in Dec","2547":"Good movie and good details story link with old part. Nice Feature behind the screen in Bluray","2548":"Ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited!  Exactly what I ordered and I received it very quickly!","2549":"Really impressed with this version! I hope and look forward to christian bale in the future..the variety of terminators in this is great and as in any sci fi our humanity is highlighted Good and bad.","2550":"What a great film! Blu ray is awesome! Not only great film and sound but tons of extra's that give a great couple hours enjoyment.","2551":"i was never a big fan of the terminator films this one was differnt,i really liked its gritty sets etc. its well worth seeing! check it out!","2552":"This movie was really good.  Confused how so many did not give it a good rating on Yahoo and other sites.  I am impressed.","2553":"Didn't even know about this addition to the series until I was looking at them on Amazon.  Will enjoy watching it with the rest of the series","2554":"Please describe the audio\/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.  The video quality was excellent.  The item description above says it is 2.40:1, but before I read that, I thought it was 2.35:1.  The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent - lot's of surround sounds and sub-woofer bass.  The movie lasted about 1 hour and 47 minutes.  I thought it was pretty good, except for the ending, which I thought was incomplete.","2555":"This is a really really really good movie and I was very glad to find the director's cut of it.","2556":"THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT OUT TO MY FRIENDS TO WATCH IT. CHRISTIAN BALE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE JOHN CONNOR.","2557":"My family thought that this DVD was in a very good condition. Enjoyed it very much","2558":"I've never been a Terminator fan maybe because I'm not an Arnold fan. I like Christian Bale since he played American Psycho. Therefore, I liked this movie. Simple as that. But if you're a huge fan of the series Terminator then indulge in owning a copy of Terminator Salvation.","2559":"I liked it the shipping was fast the Lossless audio is the best and I am also in sales so I use demo scenes from this movie to sell home audio systems ...must have!!!","2560":"Great movie, great price. I really like the movie, I went to see it in theatres and then bought this one. The video quality is amazing and the movie is awesome. No regrets.","2561":"Why do films that come out within 5 years of each other over use the in now hit actor? I would have prefered a no name actor to play John Conner.  The first time watching the movie I almost expected him to say I am Batman and throw a batarang or something. but other than this it is a great flick and follows well with the terminator line.","2562":"We rented the movie (video on demand) and loved it. We stopped it 45 minutes into the movie to refresh our drinks.....it felt like only 15 minutes had passed. Definitely worth the rental !","2563":"Excellent movie.  Not easy to pull off the machines warfare and they did it very well.  I liked the new guy, well cast, and that Asian chick was hot.  Bale needs to remove that nasty wart on his nose.  That also should be the last Terminator.  It ended perfect.  Move along Hollywood!","2564":"The Terminator story line is getting a little long in the tooth.  But, if you bought in from the beginning you have to see this latest edition.  It could be done so much better, but at least we see the story progress...or regress as the case may be.  Any \"Terminator\" fan has to see this one as well.","2565":"I saw it thinking it was going to be so terrible. Do not listen to reviewers. They think it was terrible. I liked it better than the originals. The action was great, storyline was actually pretty good, and the acting was terrific. I only found it to be a little short because I didn't want it to stop.  Action: 10\/10 Storyline: 10\/10 Length: 7\/10 Twist at the end: 10\/10  Definite must buy.","2566":"this is a great movie, of course it is not a james cameron movie, it is not supposed to be!!! but it was so much more entertaining than the other terminators. we loved it, promise you will not be dissapointed, cool action futuristic movie!!","2567":"AWESOME addition to the series :D  Saw the film 4 times in the theater!!","2568":"this movie is the best ever seen. we been waiting a long time for this particular moment. and now its here.","2569":"product was in excellent condition. shop with confidence. would buy from this seller again.","2570":"Blu Ray is the only way to watch this movie...excellent sound with surround sound setup and the picture is extra crisp.","2571":"MY FAMILY AND I LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS THE BEST ONE YET..FULL OF ACTION AND ENTERTAINMENT.. TWO THUMBS UP..","2572":"just wanted to let everyone know that target is selling the directors cut on dvd. i think it's the only place you can get it.","2573":"see it finished a few minutes ago, the action secuences are just great, the argument that connects this with the other three films is superb, the sarah connor picture, the records, Kyle Reese, and of course Arnold, Sam Worthington in deed is worth to watch as the human hybrid-terminator(he rocks here much more than Avatar) , however, hardly a heart transplant can take place in a tent, further that the surgery is performed by a veterinary!!!....mmmm talking nonsense... i give it 4 or 5 stars, nevertheless is a very good movie!","2574":"Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie. We finally get an entire movie based around the future war. Not only do we get to see the classic terminators, but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet. Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience.","2575":"Got this DVD some time ago from Amazon but wasn't able to review it until now.  The director's cut is not much different then the regular version but the extras are very nice additions. I'd reccomend this to anyone who liked the film but have not bought the DVD.","2576":"Not saying anything egative about the film itself, however it makes me mad when the public is duped into thinking that the \"theatrical\" version of the movie is the only cut of the movie that will be released on dvd and if you want the rest of the extras you have to buy it on blu ray. That is false advertising in my humble opinion.","2577":"They have the exclusive right to sell the 2 disc Director's Cut.  Go over to Target and buy it while you can.","2578":"I just don't get the negative reviews. I refused to watch it because of the many bad reviews. I finally decided to watch it last night. I was expecting a lousy flick. What a pleasant surprise. This movie is great. Almost as good as the first Terminator but definately better than parts two and three. If you don't like this movie you just can't appreciate originality and great action. 10 STARS OUT OF 10!","2579":"Already had a DVD of this movie...bought the Blu ray for the improved video quality.  I was not disappointed. The video quality on this Blu ray is excellent and consistent throughout the movie (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV).  Highly recommend if you are looking for improved video quality.","2580":"I have been hooked on the Terminator series since the 1st and this one did not disappoint at all.  Special effects and the acting were excellent!  Christain Bale never lets me down - he has become one of my favorite actors ever since American Psycho.","2581":"I have not been ale to watch the movie. The seller clearly posted this as HD, but I was too dumb to know the difference. I have no way to play this disc but that's all on me. The seller posted it correctly. I was just to hurried and did not pay attention. Since it's my error, I never asked about returning it. I'll try to resell it or just donate it if I have too.","2582":"awesome film, better then T3 and problem was storylines but this was doing the writer strike, other then that awesome movie","2583":"Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.","2584":"If you like the Terminator Series, this movie is a must. It is a very good story line with excellent effects. There's only one part of the movie that I thought was a little \"cheesy,\" but that's my opinion. I know what the reasoning behind it was, but I think it was just unnecessary. I won't say what it is because I do not want to spoil it.","2585":"To the action lover this movie will be greatly appreciated. I think that even those who are not so much impressed with action films will like this one.","2586":"The story that are we were waiting for to continue one of the most interesting series of contemporary cinema","2587":"Better than Rise of the Machines but lacking any impact From lead actors . A movie by the numbers relying on CGI and explosions like Star Wars 1 2 & 3.","2588":"They finally changed it up from the \"a new terminator is trying to kill you and I'm here to protect you\" scenario.  Good special effects and good story to entertain.","2589":"John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOME  Didn't like the John Connor character at all.  Nothing special.  But Marcus Wright - the machine\/man - he was incredible.  He was the real star of the film.  Like seriously he was.  It felt like it couldn't possibly be any other way than that he was the star.  And he was incredible - just a truly wonderful character.  The movie was ok, but the character of Marcus Wright was one of the best characters ever.  I also like Moon Bloodgood and her character, though they weren't nearly as good as Marcus Wright.","2590":"Our only Salvation is Christ.. however if we were all blown to Hell then John Conner may have to do something.. good action sequence and continuous action... at times maybe more than I would have liked but ... hey if its action you want then this movie delivers..","2591":"Christian Bale out did himself as John Conner in this 4th extension of the Terminator Saga with a Dark side never seen before! There was no mercy or compassion for the proto type Terminator Marcus Right until that proto type gave up his life for John Conner. I was completely surprised at the ending of this movie and amazed at its impact on my own thinking!  Excellent story line and drama with the best visual effects seen since T-2  Th<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001FB55HQ\">Terminator Salvation (Widescreen Edition)<\/a>is movie definitely deserves 5 stars in my book!","2592":"After seeing so many really-bad and so-so \"blockbuster\" movies recently, I was extremely pleased with this one.  Highly recommended.  Oh, the blu-ray treatment is top-notch too.","2593":"good cast, good story, great effects. good to watch in order..   ... ... ... ... .... .... ... ... ..","2594":"Outstanding; much more substance compared to other Terminators; acting on a much higher level due to Christian Bale.  The most satisfying of all, now for Terminator-Victory!","2595":"I really enjoyed this movie, as a Terminator fan I was wating long for the aftermath of the judgement day event..  The movie doesn't actually follows the same timeline as the original date, there's no laser guns and no T-800 walking around in packs.  Nice performance from Chistian Bale and Sam Worthington, great fx and sound.  The director's cut edition really leaves you kind of dissapointed as there's no valuable new material...","2596":"I almost didn't watch this movie because I could never stomach Christian Bale & by the time I was finished watching it, I had totally changed my mind about him!! I now LOVE him but especially adore Sam Worthington!! This was top notch special effects & amazing acting by all in the movie. The story line was fantastic and well written also. I think I have watched this at least 20 times already and I never get sick of it! I totally recommend this to add to your \"Terminator\" collection.","2597":"Terminator salvation is one of the best movies. I was happy to find it avaliable to download. I watch it almost every week.","2598":"It is what you would expect, but in a good way, for those who are interested in the action\/drama genre","2599":"I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen.  I still love it now.  Great movie, ton of action and great acting.  If you love buying action movies, this one is one to buy.","2600":"The emphasis on story may be gone but the gritty style of this movie will leave you yearning for a more worthy succesor to the terminator films.","2601":"Im a big fan of the Terminator Franchise and so i bought this movie to go along with my collection.When the movie arrived the case was scratchy witch wasent exactly what i was looking for but long as the disk was ok i was ok over all good movie.","2602":"This video is awesome. Remy, Juelz Santana, and Ne-Yo perform their hip-hop and R&B hits at The Roseland Ballroom in NYC and tears up the stage. There are also many new talented artists who are interviewed and music videos. I love The Spot Review show! It's like a breath of fresh air. If you are tired of seeing the same faces in the music industry on TV, you need to check out this show.","2603":"This documentary is very interesting and I recommend it. It does a good job of showing the lives of various trans-men. It deals with the struggles they each had to face as parents transitioning from female to male and mommy to daddy.","2604":"The movie was interesting.  I wish they would have gone into more detail with the lives of both the parents and the children.  Instead they just move from little clip to little clip weaving back and forth between all of the trans families which made it a little difficult to follow.","2605":"What a heartwarming, touching, perfect movie. Why doesn't someone release this gem on DVD. Don't need no special features, don't need no previews, don't need no cast bio's - just need this wonder film on DVD!","2606":"The premise of this movie is what captivated me.  The Pope on the loose.  How would or could he cope?  There are too many flaws to rate this too highly (most would think I already have, but I never tire of seeing this movie, especially with someone who hasn't seen it.  Haven't shown it to anyone who didn't like it.  Give it a view.  And by the way, I'm not the only one who'd buy the DVD immediately.","2607":"I SAW THIS FILM AS A CHILD AND IT IS ONE OF THE FILMS I AM MOST FOND OF.  IT IS RARE FOR A MOVIE TO LIVE IN THE THOUGHTS OF SOMEONE FOR SO LONG BUT I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY I WOULD FIND A COPY FOR MYSELF.  TRULY A GREAT FILM.","2608":"This is a movie that lifts me up when I'm down.  I too wish it was on DVD.  I read through a few of the five star ratings and really liked what they had to say.  I wish more people in the world were like this.  I know of few people who are very good to other people and have charitable dispositions.  I like to watch this movie and try to live the example that was set.  Please get it made into a DVD.","2609":"I saw this movie first in 1995 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love the story, the characters, the fine acting.  It is a truly a beautiful movie.  A gem.","2610":"Story, movie and acting all come together in this movie. They sure don't make them like this any more. It's a must have. I WANT IT IN WIDE SCREEN FORMAT DVD. NOW!!!","2611":"This movie is great! I have it on vhs and have watched it for years but have been waiting for an official release to dvd but it hasn't happened. When I saw that Amazon manufactures it on demand I was skeptical, but I ordered it anyway and was not disappointed in the least. The quality of this dvd is just as good as what any studio would release. So if you're hesitant in purchasing this because Amazon manufactured it, DON'T BE!  Purchase it-you won't be disappointed either!","2612":"It literally took me years to figure out the name of this movie.  I just remember seeing and loving this movie back when I was a child.  Like the 40+ others reviewing this I say, \"GIVE US A DVD OF THIS TO BUY!\"","2613":"This is such a wonderful heart warming movie! I wish that there was some way to get it out on DVD! I've watched it many times and it always makes me  believe again in goodness in the world.","2614":"I can in no way improve on what has been said already.  This film should be be treated as a classic that will be watched for many years to come.  PLEASE!!! get this onto DVD.  I will buy it immediately along with extra copies for others.  This is a real jewel!","2615":"I saw this charming film on the recommendation of my brother in law. A film about a pope who gets locked out? Eeeehhhhhhhh, I dunno.  My husband and I watched it and were absolutely charmed. We have been looking for a DVD version for the last few years to add it to our library and share with our kids.  BRING THIS GEM TO DVD!","2616":"Why, oh why, doesn't this wonderful, family, heart-warming film appear on DVD? It is a gem for any day of the week. Ponti is a wonderful Pope (and I am Methodist).  Please, pleeeeeeze, bring out in DVD format. My VHS format is old and yellow..... and fuzzy.","2617":"Wonderful movie of a young pope (for a pope) who feels he has become inaffective and sneaks off to find his way.","2618":"I was very thankful to find this movie. It's one of my favorites. Catholic or not, you'll enjoy this touching movie.","2619":"This is by no means a technically great movie, but I had seen it before and bought it anyway.  It's a sweet story, and Tom Conti does a nice job as a young and compassionate pope, fed up with the bureaucracy of his job, who accidentally gets locked out of the Vatican (in worker's clothes) with no money.","2620":"I am soooo excited that this movie is FINALLY available on DVD!  If I could own only 3 or 4 movies - this would definitely be one of them.  Heartwarming, subtle humor and a great story.  Catholic, non Catholic - it doesn't matter - you'll love the story.  Don't Miss it!","2621":"I taped this film from TV some time ago and have watched it over and over. It's funny and heartwarming. Conti and Giannini give wonderful performances.","2622":"A long lost gem, this is such a wonderful movie! Tom Conti is perfect as the Pope who's accidentally locked out of the Vatican and finds a purpose in helping a small town escape from the evil seduction of dependency on government handouts.","2623":"I Just finished watching SAVING GRACE,for the 4th or 5th time. A moving, funny, enjoyable and inspiring film with an incredible cast headed by Tom Conti, along with Giancarlo Gianinni, Fernando Rey, Erland Josephson and others. Who would have thought a movie about THE POPE could be this human. See it.","2624":"I am very happy with this purchase.  The tape artrived in good time.  The movie arrived in a nearly perfect box and the tape was also in very good shape.  I was very pleased.","2625":"I bought this for a friend because it is one of my favorite movies ever!","2626":"This is a wonderful family film that is way too hard to find.  Video stores should continue to carry it.  I'm so glad to have this video in my collection.  Every family should.","2627":"Tom Conti makes this wonderful story of a young Pope who accidentally gets locked out of the Vatican, and makes use of the situation to mingle among his flock - a small Italian town, where he makes a significant difference.   Heart-warming story.  But, more importantly portrays the human-ness and 'like the rest of us' nature of the Pope.","2628":"I ordered the movie \"Amazing Grace\" with Tom Conti and Retro Rocket Entertainment has been excellent to deal with. they were prompt in answering my concerns and very good about helping me with my concerns. they are excellent to do business with and I would recommend them highly.","2629":"I rented this movie a couple of time a few years back. It is funny and a real faith builder too.  It is a shame that the film is out of print and was never put on a DVD.  In the meantime, I can still enjoy it on my trusty VHS player.  I strongly recommend that you scoop up one of the last copies of the movie still available","2630":"What a wonderful, heart warming movie. Not to be confused with another movie of the same name starring Craig Ferguson. Tom Conti gives an exceptional performance as Pope Leo who, inadvertantly, lives among the common people. What a movie! Great seller: immediate shipping and the tape is in great shape! Thanks a bunch!","2631":"I had been looking for this movie for a long time. I'am so glad I got it. What a great story.","2632":"For the most part, surfing movies only subtly delve into the totally experience of surf adventures.  You may see an airport scene here, and a flat tire on the rental car there.  But viewers may not get the full essence of a real surfing adventure.  Endless Summer II is a tremendous mix of awesome footage at beautiful breaks, interesting experiences from the cast, and delightful break from the typical surf film.  If you have any bit of surfing blood in you, you will be extremely pleased with this pick.","2633":"This movie is pure goofy fun.  Great footage of surfers doing their thing in some of earth's most beautiful places.  The humor is so goofy and cheesy that you can't help laughing and cheering your way through the movie.  On a winter's night after playing all day in the snow, O'Connell and Weaver are the perfect guides to endless summer fun......","2634":"This is a great surfing film that shows the lives of surfers, both what they do and who they are. I highly recommend this flick for anyone who has ever surfed or thought about riding a wave. Once again Bruce Brown has out done himself.","2635":"That's a good movie with a good storie and good surfing. I've just seen it once and I don't know how many times I will watch before being bored.","2636":"Awesome video, great videography and humorous narration of two young men who trek the globe, catching waves during an \"endless summer\" of fun and adventure.","2637":"It is hard to improve on the original, but this DVD comes real close.  Any surf film can show good waves, but what separates ES II is Bruce Brown's narrative (reminiscent of ES), the characters, and how this movie flows.  There is enough non-surf events going off that it stays fresh from start to finish.  Add this one to the collection, and hope that the formats don't change too soon.","2638":"I've made it a personal tradition to watch this movie during spring break each year throughout high school.  It always gets me excited about summer.  I HIGHLY recommend this film for anybody who loves to travel to new places.  The guys in this film have the opportunity to go to several exotic places that most people wouldn't even consider for vacationing.  But each place has its own charm and appeal, and the surfers are able to have a blast wherever they end up.  Great film all around.  Awesome surfers, awesome waves, awesome producer.  Simple as that.","2639":"Simply the most classic surf video ever!  Certainly a \"must have\" for any respectful surfer","2640":"this is perhaps the greatest surfing documentary of all time. i thought no one could top the endless summer I, but clearly i was wrong.","2641":"Endless Summer II joins its predecessor in the \"Classic Surf\" movie genre. It's not quite as good as the original or I'd have given it 5 stars.","2642":"If you enjoyed Endless summer I then this is a must. This movie  captures the atmosphere of the surf scene and makes you want to just get out there and go for it. The steps of the Endless summer I characters are retraced and new exciting locations visited and surfed. A healthy dose of humour is thrown in as well","2643":"The sequel to &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; has much better surf footage than the original and I think that the soundtrack is a tad better than the first as well...but both movies are excellent...makes you wonder when they will do &quot;The Endless Summer 3&quot; !!! Take me along for the third installment !","2644":"This is a very good movie with some excellent surfing footage with both long and short boards. The movie does a great job of capturing the same feeling of the original 1964 movie with a more modern updated feel. I really appreciated the shortboard footage in this movie along with the humorous narration. This movie is a must-own if you are a surfer or anyone that appreciates the soul and art of the sport.","2645":"This is a good movie.  I first watched it on HBO about five years ago.  It made me want to surf.  If you don't surf, you'll want to learn how after watching this.  I was disheartened to find out that a lot of the experiences in the movie were scripted... I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone so I'll stop there.","2646":"If you are a surfer who is stoked to see some great surfers riding the best waves in the world, this movie is made for you.","2647":"This is the coolest movie that I have seen in a long time. I saw it about 2 years ago and I still think that it is my favorite movie of all time.  Even if you don't surf it is a fun movie to watch. It had great camera shot  and humor. The parts in Australia are the best in my opinion. I lve the  seen with the smallest wave too.","2648":"The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly.  The good is the all that is surfing, which this movie is all about.  The bad  is Hollywood's corporate stranglehold on creativity.  The ugly is all those  amateur movie  reviewers, myself included.  However, most don't know the true (behind the  scenes)  production and post-production struggles between the surfers  involved in the project and the funding &amp; distribution company, which  suffocated many talents. There was some pain involved. Yet despite all the  struggles, an incredible and entertaining 35mm surf documnetary was made,  and should be seen all.","2649":"If you surf, or want to surf, or just like the ocean, then get this video. Great footage of some awesome waves(breaks) and also a KILLER sountrack as well. Gary Hoey and Dick Dale. Cant go wrong with that! I just wish they  would release it on DVD now....","2650":"The video show some of the best  surfers and breaks ever.  The footage is great.  Some of the best surf in the world.","2651":"I would have to disagree that this is better than the original. I'm not saying that it is bad, because that would be blasphemy, but the orginal still remains my favorite.","2652":"Communion is a terrifically atmospheric sci-fi that scared the wits out of me. I found the scene in the woods with the lights to be all too familiar. I heard that Walken was and is a total non-believer. He's sure a great actor. When he was scared trick or treating I jumped out of my skin. Needless to say, I highly recommended this alien abduction movie that's based on the alleged true recollections of Whitley Strieber. Watch it and see if it rings any bells.","2653":"...watching Walken & Crouse is worth the price of the disc alone  honorable mention to the kid and the 'lil blu guys  \"....you know how these things go...but all I can say is that Im glad this is not my bedroom.... so anyway, try to have a good night....OK?\"  Interestingly I have a 2004 105 min version PAL from Germany [Die Besucher]-is cut differently and because of PAL 5% speedup that would mean the film would be about 110 min in NTSC land","2654":"The movie closely follows the book some say its a hoax a lie or imagination.I say lets find out great story 80's dated style but an overall bizarre account","2655":"This is a movie about the true abduction experience of Whitley Strieber and his family at his upstate New York cabin. This is a really good dramatization of his experiences. Anyone interested in the subject of UFOs should have a copy in his collection. Highly Recommended!","2656":"Nothing to do 100 cartwheels over, but a reasonably enjoyable film.  Lindsay Crouse plays such strong-willed career women, and it was interesting to see her as an everyday housewife.","2657":"As most film adaptations of great novels go, this could have been better. There were a few pieces missing that I felt were very important in the book. This movie was more about the effect on the family and just what happened to Whitely.  I will say though that Christopher Walken was a great choice. His reactions to the \"visitors\" are just classic.","2658":"This was a great movie; and introduced the dynamic acting of Christopher Walken to me.  It also scared the you-know-what out of me.  I must have seen this movie a dozen times and still get scared each time.  If you've ever had even a remotely similar experience as what is depicted in this movie, you'll be leaving the lights on at bedtime guaranteed.","2659":"This movie freaking rules. When I was a kid it was on every time I was sick home from school, on public TV, at about noon. It was very consistent. I TRUST THIS MOVIE. Buy it. It will always be there for you in times of need and is perfect with soup and kleenex and a couch.","2660":"This is a good old fashioned adventure, with some comedy and good natured suspense. We remember it from when it was released, but my 8 year old grandaughter loved it - she watched it twice! We are a little disappointed in the quality of the DVD; it does seem quite grainy and not much better picture that the VHS.","2661":"The movie has a good story line.  The actors do a great job.  Special effect (for 1983) are good.  I saw this when it came out in theaters.  This was the first movie I watched with Molly Ringwald and became an instant fan.  I am glad I added it to my collection.","2662":"This was the first movie I ever saw with Molly Ringwold.  I knew she was something special by this movie.  It's a good movie if you like Science Fiction.","2663":"So much cheese and corn you get cheesy popcorn! This movie is a classic though, it makes you laugh the whole way through. What were they thinking when they made this? \"It will be the next blocbuster movie since star wars!\"Funny stuff worth owning it!","2664":"I first owned this flic on VHS tape when it first came out. I loved it! I played it many times till one of my relatives hi-graded it and destroyed it in his poorly maintained VCR. When I tryed to find another copy I couldn't; so sad. At last, Amazon, and I'm happy again! For fast paced total entertanment that doesn't require much heavy thinking this cant be beat.","2665":"Picture a Tough-hard as nails space captain who owes more money than there is in Fort Knox...  Pay every one off, easy-just rescue three hot women from a forbidden world.  Who can he call on for help, a money hungry space-cop, a hot robot bombshell, a junker space ship that's just spare parts flying in formation, and a young survivor girl.  If you enjoy fighting mutants, rescuing damsels in distress and good one liners, here's your movie.","2666":"This is one of my favorite movies.  I watched this way back, and I later bought the tape when the price was $25 and considered it a great value.  I still watch that movie once in a while.  It's high adventure and an all together great movie.","2667":"The movie is kind of fun. Not bad for a 'B' movie and not as bad as 'Men In Black' This one I would at least watch again without trying to chew my arm off. (yep you guessed it , I cant say the same for 'MIB')","2668":"I can't believe some of these jobs they have in the military!  Very cool  -- and dangerous stuff!  Great video!","2669":"An exellent DVD, featuring all the great players of past and present, full of highlights interviews and exellent story line, describing each of an ultimate player's skill, like scoring, speed, mentality, etc. Exellent music to go with the story, and the final highlight featuring michael jordan could'nt be better (even thou I'm a Laker Fan), wich made me also order ultimate jordan eventualy.","2670":"Talking about music, would anybody be expert (and kind) enought to help me on that : what's the name of that GREAT Funk piece of music, kind of guitar, drum & piano stuff, playing when they are showing all those great shots and moves by George \"Iceman\" Gervin, Michael Jordan and Dr J ? it's between the 17'00\" and 18'40\" time in the documentary.  thanks a lot to anybody who can help me. :p","2671":"this movie is a surprisingly delightful comedy.  any movie that makes you laugh is great","2672":"I got the product faster than I expected. I am very pleased with the whole process.","2673":"My Best Friend's Wedding is probably Julia Roberts best romantic comedy, even better than Pretty Woman. Dermont Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, and Rupert Everett also star in this tale of a food critic played by Roberts who is invited to intend her best friend's upcoming nupitals, but the thing is she is in love with her best friend and tries everything in her power to break up the wedding. I won't give away the ending but this is actually a good and solid romantic comedy and I think everyone who decides to watch will throughly enjoy it. Good luck!","2674":"I enjoyed this deliteful romantic comedy.I am not much of a Julia Roberts fan But I enjoyed her in this movie.","2675":"I hold this movie close to my heart, why you may ask? Because I was going thru the same thing Julia Roberts was going thru in this movie. I was in love with someone who did not belong to me. It was a hot affair 10 years ago that ended disastrously, and I ended up the loser at the end. The lesson here is, Life Goes ON. Julia's performance was so true and honest, she always steals my heart. Great movie!","2676":"Thanks for getting this DVD to me while I am stationed over seas.","2677":"Jules Potter is in love with her bdest friend Micheal, but he is about to marry someone else.  Jules will do anything to mess up his big day.  This movie is loads of fun and laughs.  When they break out into song in one scene, you can't help but sing along.  I love this movie and watch it often.  It's one of my favorites with Roberts next to Pretty Woman.","2678":"One of my favorite Roberts movies, and just the way I like her: funny and romantic. The plot is not original but the characters breathe new life into this complex problem of how to steal a man. I loved Diaz, her best role to date if you ask me. The entire movie is a blast, but has an almost disappointing ending.<p>Great DVD lots of features, great movie, great soundtrack.","2679":"This movie was excellent.  It had comedy, love, and sad moments.  And it when totally against what I expected to happen!!  I am ashamed to say that I wanted the main guy to dump Cameron!!  <p>All in all, a great film.  I don't own it, but I just might buy it.","2680":"This movie kicks butt!  I only wish I had two friends like Micheal and George!  You can't help but smile at this movie.  The songs are awesome too-especially their own rendition of &quot;I say a little prayer for  you&quot;.  Rupert Everett steals every scene he's in and will completly  steal your heart. You should definetly see this.","2681":"So what if this movie doesn't have the most plausible plot! It's not supposed to. When people ask me what my favorite movie is, I tell them this one without a second's hesitation. I think I saw it 7 times at the theater.  It reminds you of the first time you told somebody you liked them and how  nervous you were. I do like the ending because it brings the movie back to  reality. You don't always win. To anyone who likes this movie, I would  suggest seeing &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; and &quot;Return to Me.&quot;","2682":"It has Julia Roberts...nothing else needs to be said. Buy it!","2683":"THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC....IT HAS LINES THAT HAVE YOU REPEATING OVER AND OVER AGAIN....MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE WATCHING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER...ITS A NICE FAMILY MOVIE.","2684":"I love this movie. I am a helpless romantic and this movie is funny and just that, a romatic comedy. I watch it over and over.Julia  and Cameron fit together!!!!!","2685":"I don't understand all the fuss about Julia Roberts, she doesn't play very well and she isn't even good looking! Cameron Diaz instead is magnificiant in her role, she's totaly convincing and really beautiful. This movie deserves 5 stars mainly because she's in it. The story is quite good, it's funny at times. If you want some entertainement or you want to see Cameron Diaz, buy this movie.","2686":"Julia Roberts may not have been able to steal the heart of the groom, but she sure did steal the audiences' hearts. This romantic comedy is funny and touching. Not just Roberts, but the entire cast is surely working at their  best during this film. I love this movie, and I never get tired of watching  it over and over. If you are a fan of movies like Runaway Bride, Ghost,  etc., then make sure that you at least rent this movie for yourself.","2687":"Before seeing this movie I wasn't much of a Julia Roberts fan. But now I am! I thought she played an excellent part. As well as the other characters. In the beginning I predicted what I thought was going to happen. I was completely wrong! That's one reason why I liked it so much. I also liked how the suspense kept you in the movie. Like what she was going to next and if she would ever get Michael. I also liked the part at the restaurant where they sing &quot;I'll Say a Little Prayer for you&quot;.","2688":"this is the best movie i have ever seen! it makes me cry just thinking about it... i really recomend buying this movie cause its da bomb.. no seriously! if your the kind of person that loves to cry and loves sad  movies.. this is the movie for you! although this movie is suposed to be a  comedy it is also very sad.. even if i watch it twice in a row it still  makes me cry cause i feel so sorry for Julia Roberts... :( well good  luck... as i said again... its REALLY!  a good movie","2689":"julia roberts is not good at all,but diaz is perfect even if her musical skills are not revealed. the story is funny, so buy this movie","2690":"1997 couldnt of happened without this movie!!! funny!! Julia Roberts and Camron Diaz are great in this film!!! Must have!! I cant believe its almost 10 years since it came out. Feels like yesterday when i first saw it.","2691":"I received the item in perfect condition and the shipping was qucik, as well.  Thank you!","2692":"This is one of my favorite movies.I've watched it over and over again 'coz I was captivated by the story and cast. I really loved this flick,it's really hilarious,and cute!  Julia looks great in the movie,and she truly  did a good job.This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh and gets you  thinking  what you really want,and who you are.Go watch it!","2693":"This is my daughter's all-time favorite movie and has been on her wish list since she started it. I was happy to FINALLY get a copy for her. It arrived in excellent condition and very promptly. The seller was great and my daughter has already selected her charmingly handsome gay escort should her \"best\" friend-boy marry.","2694":"IT'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE....SHOWS US THE FOIBLES OF LIFE AND HOW EVERYTHING GOES OUT THE WINDOW WHEN MR. RIGHT COMES ALONG.  JULIA ROBERTS IS PERFECT IN THIS ROLE AND DERMOT MULRONEY CAN HOLD HIS OWN ON SCREEN WITH HER. LOVE CAMERON DIAZ AS THE 'OTHER WOMAN'.  PATS ON THE BACK FOR THE CAST SELECTIONS HERE, NOBODY PLAYS A BAD PART.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I HAVE VIEWED IT MANY TIMES AND I WILL WATCH IT MANY MORE TIMES IN THE FUTURE.","2695":"This is a really good romantic movie. I love Rupert in this movie. And I am so glad that Julia's character failed to break up her best friend's wedding. I also thought Cameron Diaz was good. The ending is simply the best.","2696":"I just find this an absolutely delightful film. It's very well cast and although the storyline goes from the sublime to the ridiculous, it's still manages to keep you entertained.","2697":"I love this movie!! One of my all time favorite movies with a bitter sweet ending so to speak. I love all the actresses\/actors that are in it, they did a great job!!","2698":"Julia Robert is a friend to a guy who is about to get married. There's one problem she loves him, she tries to break up the wedding. And in the process she figures out that he's truly in love with her. At the end the wedding was a success, and Julia falls for a different guy at the reception. I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!","2699":"I just love it!  It's a romantic comedy which was enjoyable to watch and would watch it again and again!  I love the humor and some singing done in the movie.","2700":"This is a kind-of real-life romantic comedy.  There is much criticism about the ending, but it's how real life turns out.  Julianne's (Roberts) fight to get her man is not necessarily reflective of true life--which is not a bad thing--but it's hilarious.  I recommend this movie if you want to cry and laugh in the same two hours.","2701":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's very sweet from beginning to end.  Julia Roberts plays Juliana, a former tomboy who finds out her best friend Michael (Dermott Mulroony) is getting married to a  younger woman, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz).  Juliana then realizes she's in love  with Michael and tries to stop the wedding.  It's a fun movie with romance  mixed with comedy.  It reallymakes you cry at the end.  If you like Notting  Hill, you'll love this too!","2702":"Julia Roberts is the meddling woman who had her chance with the hero and wasted it, and now that he is about to be married, tries to snatch him from his wife-to-be. The meddling is both pathetic and reprehensible, and I am glad that the meddler ends up doing the right thing and the story ends as it should. Not heart-warming but enjoyable, with fantastically good looking male and female leads.","2703":"This is a great movie. I enjoy watching My Best Friends Wedding every time. I specially love the beginning when the four girls are singing a song and doing a little dance. Sometimes I will rewind that part a few times before watching the movie.","2704":"Julia Roberts does a great job of playing the bad guy and then redeeming herself. Cameron Diaz is great as well. If you're willing to take this for what it is then you will have a lot of fun watching this and be vastly entertained. This movie is 20 years old and it has aged very well. P.S. There are some musical interludes which made me smile.","2705":"This movie is great. I have watched it several times. The acting is great and there is alot of fun to be had.","2706":"The item that i ordered got here in record speed! I was really happy to see it came so fast.  The DvD that I had purchased was in amazing condition, no scratches, like new!","2707":"If you're a fan of romantic comedies, this one should definitely make your list.  Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz are both charming.  There isn't much soppy romance, just a lot of amusing scenes, mostly featuring Roberts behaving somewhat outlandishly.  The movie doesn't drag on, and just generally fun.  Recommended.  Roberts flies to Chicago to try and stop an ex from marrying Cameron Diaz.  It's obviously a poor plan, but it's funny to watch.  If you don't like romantic comedies, obviously, skip it!","2708":"I rate this a 4 only because I haven't seen the DVD yet, but a friend once loaned me the VHS version. I think I watched it three times over the course of a couple months. In one case, I watched all 6 hours straight through (minus bathroom breaks of course). Another reviewer used the phrase &quot;life changing&quot;, and I agree completely. I have continued to draw inspiration from this film for 5 years. With the DVD, maybe I can go for another 50. PS: The soundtrack for this film is out on RealWorld. Also recommended.","2709":"Really impressed with this movie.  It was worth the money.  By watching the behind the feature, it really helped to understand the movie from beginning to end.  Looking forward to watching the movie a second time.","2710":"THE DVD I GOT IS NOT VERY GOOD, IT DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES AND THE IMAGE IS BLURRY, BUT IS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I TRIED TO GET THIS PRODUCT, SO I SHOULD BE GLAD YOU GOT IT FOR ME. THANK YOU, BEATRIZ BELTRAN.","2711":"This is the best adaptation of the Mahabharata ever that i have seen. It is definitely something to own.","2712":"Pours wisdom right into the soul. It changed my life. The largest poem on Earth and it is about YOU! This 6 hour film is derived from the 9 hour stageplay. Absolutely unique and tells you about the meaning of life.","2713":"I expected the unexpected and got just that... NBA Video explores the greatest upsets and overachievers in NBA history.  From the legendary championship run of the 1977 Portland Trail Blazers to the heroic tales of  Scottie Pippen and Kevin Garnett, NBA Upsets &amp; Underdogs recounts the  NBA's most inspirational stories.  Even with the odds stacked against them,  these featured teams and players, including host Bill Walton, have managed  to steal the headlines with their epic performances.  I was truly  inspired...","2714":"This movie seems so interesting cuase we will see how Barbie lives in the realworld with the new friends Tia, Courtney, Kevin & Todd. & for the first time an Mean character will be introduce in Barbie's world her name is Raquelle and she the Queen of mean aand she hates Barbies I already saw the doll on Ebay I can't wait to get her","2715":"I LOVE THIS MOVE!!! They have to come out with a second one. This movie is awesome. I'm a teen and i love it! i loved the other barbie movies but for once it is about real life. And the songs rock. i hope they come out with a soundtrack. This movie should definately be bought. It is fun with todays humor (only the good ones) and is great even for teenagers. take my word for it. It is amazing.","2716":"The movie is not your normal animation... but it's cute and does have a good moral story line.  Barbie has a band and my 5 year old daugther loves the open 'number'.  Good buy for anyone that likes Barbie.","2717":"I completely LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd movie ! ! ! ! The girls in the movie are between the ages of 15 and 16. They're in their sophmore or second year of high school so it's nice for tweens and teens. I love this movie and it has a nice lesson at the end. It plays perfectly and it arrived two days early. This is my second favorite Barbie movie  next to Barbie Mariposa ). I've only had it for a week and I've watched it over 20 times :D ! ! ! ! Very nice buy :).","2718":"They love all the Barbie movies. This one is no exception. My older two like it more then the younger 3. They like the farie ones and princess ones better. I think the older 2 can relate more to this one. I love that they keep these movies so clean and there is always a lesson to be learned and the characters have good values.","2719":"I am the mother of a Barbie-obsessed 4-year-old and bought this unaware of the plot.  I like the movie but think it's too mature for my daughter right now.  It would be great for a girl in middle school however.  I did find it entertaining.","2720":"This is a Barbie dvd that teaches some real life lessons and inspired my daughter to start a journal.  What more could a mom want in a dvd?  Oh yeah, good music.  It had that too.","2721":"Wow, I'm kinda glad Barbie did this. A teen like movie, I can't wait to watch it. but I wonder why it's showing on TV before it comes out. Oh well, I'm thinking of watching it caue it looks really good. Bratz, Danny Phantom, and My Scene ROCK!!!","2722":"The DVD was received in great condition and in a timely manner.  I will order from seller again.","2723":"This is old Fat Chance Bellydance beginners class in a new cover. If you like FCB, tribal fusion, or fun way to burn calories this is the Thing! Good for all levels, easy to follow for newbies , fun way to drill basics for more advanced students.","2724":"The acting and story are superb. Blending a great western and history lesson in the what occurred in the late 1800's. If you are a Robert Duvall fan you will love it!","2725":"Duvall at his best! Thomas Haden Church absolutely fantastic! The best western in years! Simply put...cinema doesn't get any better than this!","2726":"Thank you Mr. Hill, and especially you, Mr. Duvall, for this wonderful piece of work. Whenever nature gets either one of you up at night, you can can go back to sleep knowing you did good, real good. Thank you.","2727":"ROBERT DUVALL IS GOOD IN ALL THE MOVIES HE HAS MADE. THIS IS ONE OF HIS GREATEST WITH ACTION, LOVE INTEREST AND SUPPORT FROM HIS CO-ACTORS. THIS IS RIGHT UP WITH ASSINATION TANGO. THANKS MR DUVALL","2728":"1.  I watched half of this via cable while on the road and was so intrigued by it that I got the DVD later on.  2.  Others have mentioned the pros \/ cons of this movie;  I just think it's one of the best Westerns out there--> great acting, a definite unique twist to the usual Western storyline, and it's based (I don't know how loosely) on a true story.  3.  A definite 5 star.","2729":"An awesome movie.  I had seen it twice and decided I had to own it!","2730":"We had previously seen this movie.  It was so good we wanted to add it to our library.  We enjoyed seeing it again.  We plan to watch it again and share it with our friends.  Thank you for your prompt service.","2731":"This is really a great film to see! Good westerns are getting harder to come by these days. Maybe Hollywood will wise up and make more films of this caliber. Not a moment too soon!","2732":"I thought good westerns died with John Wayne, but this movie will rank high with the classic westerns of yesteryear. Robert Duvall has true grit.","2733":"This is a great western [mini-series] that should be on everyone's list of Top 25 westerns of all time. It entertains as a western and has an important social message as well. Robert Duvall is amazing as usual and Thomas Haden Church and the supporting cast are excellent as well. If you haven't seen this yet you're in for a wonderful treat and if you've seen it before as I have, at least three times, you'll remind yourself how perfect this western is; and it's beautiful in High Definition!","2734":"I thouroughly enjoyed this 2 disc feature. Robert Duvall just keeps getting better and better at this type of role he plays. I could still see glimpse's of old Gus McCrae in him. I particularly noted the diabolical scheme of infection ridden blankets being issued out to the American Indians. I'm glad this movie has brought the attention of the poor suffering Asian's to light also.","2735":"I enjoy a great Weatern especially one starring Robert Duvall. I now have, what he calls his trilogy viz. Lonesome Dove, Open Range, and now Broken Trail. Robert Duvall and Clint Eastwood Weaterns are thoroughly enjoyable. I should like to mention I find Amazon provide an excellent service including s perfect follow-up to the purchase. Thank You.  Mike Davies","2736":"A very good western, with somewhat of a chick flick imbedded, meaning my wife enjoyed it too.","2737":"Robert Duvall in another western in the league of Lonesome Dove? You bet, and with Thomas Hayden Church playing an equally as good part.I've watched this movie three times and I'll probably watch it another time before I put it in the rack.","2738":"This movie looks so good on Blu-ray Disc. The Story is Good!!!    So own Broken Trail today.","2739":"I absolutely loved this movie.  I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this movie was different.  It actually had depth to it and wasn't just some gunslinging western.  I liked the little romance part and the way things ended between Tom and Sun Foy.","2740":"I really enjoyed the entire DVD but being an old time traditionalist, I was not happy with the ending which was just plain depressing.  Robert Duvall has now set the standard for resurrecting the old time westerns and proves that there is a demand for good quality movies not depending on sex or excessive violence in order to garner viewers.........  Mr. Duvall has now become one of my favorite actors and joins my other favorite Tom Selleck................","2741":"I love westerns and am glad to see they are making more of them with great success.","2742":"This is a movie well worth watching over and over it is a clean exciting movie that leaves you wanting more of the same. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000GFRI4K\">Broken Trail<\/a>  As always Robert Duvall out does himself once again. A must watch for anyone who loves westerns.","2743":"This movie was recommended to me by a friend as one I would like being a big Western fan (especially of more modern Westerns!) I bought this Blu-Ray with nothing else to go on and it was pretty good. I didn't realize that it is a two disc\/two-part movie and it is quite long, but despite that it is a good and entertaining story","2744":"A must see for anyone who enjoys Robert DuVall.  Great cast....and oh what a lovely story.  Well worth seeing even if you're not a \"cowboy\" so to speak.  So get out the popcorn and watch a spectacular movie, the story line just keeps you right in the movie.","2745":"Love Robert Duvall and in this movie he is at his best.  He looks to be a real horseman as I have known quite a few in my day.  Very authentic.  Well made movie with beautiful scenery.  As a matter of fact, I think we'll watch it again tonight.","2746":"It is not every actor who can portray an Irish mob lawyer, a radio evangelist and a seasoned cowboy (my favorite) all with the same verve and mastery.  And you've got to love a man who knows how to ride a horse. Duvall rides his horse like he's driving a Cadillac - with total comfort, style and ease.  Very sexy.","2747":"This is a great movie, of course my husband & myself enjoy Robert Duvall. This movie shows the decent side of some cowboys, & the ruthless side of a few. You don't know what will happen next as they drive the 500 horses and encounter Chinese girls. I think the show was very well done.","2748":"Great Classic Western with a twist!  A father and his step son work to take a group of horses across country to sell them to the Army, then are sidetracked as they try to save a group of Chinese girls from being delivered to a Brothel in the West.  They treat them as sisters and daughters and the relationship is both sweet and tragic as they end up forced to fight the \"owner\" as she sends men to try to retrieve them.  Highly recommend this if you like westerns with good stories.","2749":"Great western, heartwarming, with strong story line and characters.It's hard to find a western, that's really good anymore. Thumbs up.","2750":"I fell in love with this movie. The cinematography is beautiful and the setting is idyllic.  Robert Duval proved once again what depth he has as an actor.  He is a true story teller with his craft.  I hadn't seen the supporting actor, Thomas Hayden Church in anything other than \"Sideways\" and was skeptical about him pulling off the role of Robert Duval's nephew.  He surprised me with his believable character.  The story is truly remarkable when you consider that it is based on real lives.  (Is that a spoiler?)  I highly recommend this movie!","2751":"Yup - it's Robert at his best.  If you like the actor - ya gotta like the movie.  A feel good - good vs evil typical western.  Personally - it's a much needed break from all of the outrageous - filthy talking - so called western sagas.  If you miss the good old days - & want to be transported back to a kinder era - you'll love this movie!","2752":"This is one of the best Westerns to come out in several years. It reminds me of of some of the older Westerns, great story and great acting. You can't beat Robert Duvall, he just makes you believe he's an old Cowboy. Thomas Haden Church missed his calling, he could have made some good Westerns over the years. The only problem is nobody writes enough good ones these days. Hopefully THC will get that chance to make a few more in his career.","2753":"Wonderful epic-flavored double-length western that does everything fine. Scriptwriters from Deadwood - you should be taking notes.","2754":"best tv movie i have seen in a long long time. it was great.","2755":"This in one of the best westerns of the modern era. I was a stuntman in Hollywood during the 50's when the western was it's most popular. I worked on some huge projects but none as good as todays western. Broken Trail in as good as.....or better, then OPEN RANGE, THE UNFORGIVEN or SILVERADO. Duvall is the \"real\" western cowboy. I worked with him on THE PURSUIT OF D. B. COOPER in 1980 and it doesn't appear that he has changed hardly at all. I recommend this film and guarantee you will watch it over and over.","2756":"I was introduced to this mini series via the Louis L'Amour discussion forum and buying via amazon let me get the story before it was even considered for distribution in Australasia.  The filming and locations for this story are magnificent and this is equalled by the quality of the cast and story line.  The use of subtitles and script in mandarin are no hinderance to the story.  Can highly recommend the purchase of this DVD","2757":"This is a fantastic western that certainly urges me to read the novel. The attention to details regarding the time period adds to the flavor of this action\/drama. The story-line has plenty of trail grit as well as a realistic portrayal of early prostitution and the true fate of most saloon girls. If you're a western lover, this is a must see.  Chrissy K. McVay - Author","2758":"Great Movie, showing how ordinary people can show and practice human kindness and compassion to those less fortunate. A must see for movie buffs.","2759":"This is one of my very favorite movies!  The DVD was packaged very well, and delivery was lightning fast.  Many thanks!  Would highly recommend to others!","2760":"Broken Trail is a well produced Duvall film, not avaiable in Australia. Was very pleased to obtain it via Amazon, your service is impeccable. Not so pleased to recieve the DVD's still in USA format, but got over this by burning them into a format suitable for Australian equipment. Suggest you may take this into account when processing future orders.","2761":"This was an excellent movie, yet I had never even heard of it before I accidently found it in a bargain bin.","2762":"Church and Duvall team up for an excellent movie in the tradition of Lonesome Dove.  A movie should be like a good book only in video and this one definitely fits that criteria.  A recommended see.  Doug Gollihar\/Author & Writer","2763":"I recently have been enjoying Westerns, and I ordered Broken Trail. Great performances from the whole cast, and lovely scenery too.  Robert DuVall and Thomas Hayden Church are terrific in this unique, compelling story--which is based on a true story.  It will keep your attention with a good storyline and lots of action and even a little romance.  I definately recommend this film.","2764":"Beautiful story - great acting - gave one an insight into how the west really was - loved it - would recommend","2765":"Excellent rendition of time on the trail drives.  Thomas Hayden Church shows more acting depth than previous roles have allowed.  Duvall, great old cowboy, as usual.","2766":"this series is great. duvall,church and gwendolyn yeo are magnificent. the story was moving and made me weep at certain times.all the asian girls  were so pretty and sweet.it is a shame asian women were sex slaves in this country and others. we learn from this film and hopefully the love between the cowboys and the asian girls will spread worldwide. this film is highly recommemded.","2767":"If you were an equestrian or just loved horses and real honest people, you will Love this movie. Well worth the money.","2768":"this is a great movie and what a amzing story line about the human sprit .I can watch this movie all the time ...5 stars in my book","2769":"We bought this as a gift for my father-in-law.  He is a fan of westerns and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.","2770":"Just loved this miniseries. Robert Duvall is absolutely perfect, as is Thomas Hayden Church. Great story, perfectly executed.","2771":"You really can't go wrong watching Robert Duvall and this is no exception.  It has a good cast and is an enjoyable western.  If you're a lover of the Western genre then it's a good way to kick back for a few hours and go back a century.","2772":"The camera work and scenery here is awesome. Even if the story line were not great this would still be a movie worth watching for the natural beauty of the horses and countryside. However, the story is a great story I enjoy watching this movie every time. Great acting.","2773":"This is one of Robert Duvall's best performances.  If you are a fan, this is a must have.  You'll want to have this in your collection.","2774":"This was a good movie, all 3 hours of it.  I would highly recommend it to any western fan.","2775":"There aren't many actors today who can lay claim to the title \"dedicated actor\", but Robert Duvall can, anytime. His acting always delivers in one way or another. He is definitely at home in all of his western roles. From Open Range to Broken Trail, Duvall delivers.","2776":"Very good -- never saw it when it first came out -- don't know how I missed it.","2777":"Robert Duvall stars in another great western.  This is a great movie.  It would of been nice if it was all on one DVD, it is broken up into 2 halves.","2778":"I CONSIDERED THIS A VERY INTERTAINING MOVIE.  IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY ENTREST VERY WELL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LONGER THAN AVERAGE MOVIE. THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS WERE VERY GOOD AND EXTREAMELY BELEAVABLE.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LIKE IT.","2779":"I acted in this movie, so I am alittle biased, but it was not what I had thought, more drama, less action, but a good movie all the same","2780":"I would compare this movie to BBC Planet Earth. Both films are great, have a lot of amazing shots and a few not so amazing. My machine plays this movie at about half of computing power, electricity is filtered, HDTV (used as monitor)calibrated with Spider2Express. This Blu-ray release is not as good as 3:10 To Yuma. I would still recommend this purchase.","2781":"Different kind of story but excellently made and good to the end.","2782":"This movie is incredible!  It has a different twist to it that only makes it more appealing.  Duvall and Church are excellent together and I really enjoyed Church's character.  Great acting by all.","2783":"What a pleasure to watch, at last, a western of the kind which made us dream of America. Every image of that movie could be a Norman Rockwell picture or one of the XIX - XX century great american paintings.  I don't know if the American Dream is still alive, but such a movie certainly keeps the Dream of America as such.","2784":"This is the story of the founding of Haythorn Ranch in Arthur,Nebraska ([...]) The founder trailed 500 head of horses from Oregon to start the operation which today is known for their excellent stock of horses. I don't know how true the details are but the story is based in reality and you can visit the place today. The current proprietors are direct descendents of the main character in the story and are delightful people. They not only breed excellent horses but also provide a true Western setting for weddings and events. Speaking from first hand experience.","2785":"Another great performance from Robert Duvall, who seems to have a knack for performing fine western characters.  Thomas Haden Church gives a equally fine performance with the added bonus of really looking like a weathered old time cowboy. All of the actors give fine authentic performances, esp the bad guys. The result is a good story well told. I just had to add it to my DVD collection.","2786":"Robert Duvall - his usual superb self in the role of a western character.  High praise also for Thomas Haden Church.....splendid performance.","2787":"shipped in timely manner.  purchased for gift--saw part of it on TV.  looked good for western fan","2788":"Item arrived on time and in great shape. Who does not like a good wrestern? Robert Duvall is always great to watch!!!!!!!!!","2789":"Kind of like old time westerns.  Kind good hero's and very bad, Bad Guys.","2790":"This is a great movie that I wanted toadd tomy collection.  It arrived in a timely manner and as described.  No problems and no complaints.","2791":"The movie was a described.  It came even sooner than it was suppose to. The \"sender\" was quite detailed and everything is great.  i will use this sender again, when possible.","2792":"I have not viewed this film, but have read other reviews.  I realize Robert Duvall had larger roles in his named western trilogy.  But he makes an excellent imprint on the Walter Hill movie of Geronimo which starred Wes Studi as Geronimo, Matt Damon as a young officer.  It was a great movie and is still available.  I will be getting Broken Trail soon.","2793":"The movie was for my grandmother for Christmas.  She loved it......into Westerns.","2794":"Mr. Duvall, thank you for your persistance in getting this movie to the TV screen.  It is a wonderful portrayal of the Old West, two men, and the plight of Chinese in the Old West.","2795":"beautiful settings, wonderful casting, good storyline and screenplay, well edited, fantastically performed by almost every role player. what can you say and enjoy more of this kinda movie!? a nostalgic revisit of the 'lonesome dove' and its similar characters. the galloping horses in the picturestic mountains and plateaus, a pleasant and wonderful viewing experience.","2796":"I said it before -- Duvall can cowboy, period. I was born in Nevada, in the late 40s ( Gad, that makes me sound old! ), and I grew up around horses and drovers on a ranch. Duvall and Church have captured the feel of the old West -- the manners or lack therof, the life on the trail, and everyone who would like to see a little slice of life before modern conveniences should watch this.","2797":"I saw this movie for the first time on American Movie Classics (AMC) and just kept wanting to see it again and again. This is one of my favorite movies now. The story is unique and riveting.  Robert Duval and Thomas Haden Church are wonderful in this movie. I love it because the main characters, Church and Duvall, are honorable men in a lawless, wild part of our history.  I wish the story were really true. There's plenty of horse riding, shooting and fighting, but there's also undercurrents of romance and love. It's just a great movie!","2798":"This is a wonderful western withsomething to say, a great story line and wonderfull cast.  Robert Duvall is one of my all time favorite actors and he does another bang up job here.  I was also impressed by Thomas Haden Church, I never imagined him as the prototypical cowboy but he does a great job here.  Oh yeah!","2799":"The scenery makes it worth the upgrade to Blu-ray.  Add that to a great plot, great cinematography, and award-winning acting, you get a movie that you might put in your personal 'top ten' list.  Yep, it's that good.","2800":"This movie was like old time hollywood.  Then they had class.  Today mostly junk.  I loved this movie. Robert Duvall and all were marvelous and as I watched this movie I was entranced.  Why did this not win an award?  Stupid hollywood. I hope more quality movies TV or other will be made.  But I doubt it.  Hooray for Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church.","2801":"The movie took me to another world. At the same time the actions scenes are fantastic. It is so emotional. Robert Duval is a great actor and he outperforms his role. I felt love and friendship when I was watching this movie. I bought this DVD and added it to my collection because I feel that I will be able to watch it time and time again. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.","2802":"Honestly, Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church make this a four-star movie.  It's a classic western story, with clearly defined good guys and bad guys.  The character interaction is top-notch.  There's no multi-million dollar special effects, but the acting by all is rock solid.  Print Ritter (Duvall) and Tom Harte (Tomas Haden Church) unexpectedly become the guardians of five abused and abandoned Chinese girls in the midst of their horse drive.","2803":"FINALLY!!! I love American Westerns.  I love US History, Native Americans, horses and adventures.  I grew up thinking \"Why can't Chinese people have significant leading roles in the Westerns?\" Were we not a part of the American history??? Railroad anyone? California Gold Rush? This is better than my wildest dreams!  5 Chinese girls in leading, respectable, roles in a Western!!!  I am so happy! Thomas Haden Church is so hot because of this role!  Everyone!!!  Go watch it!","2804":"Both Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church excel and head a marvelous cast in this gripping western that is filled with amazingly beautiful images of the American Northwest.  About 3 hours long, but it seems much less.  I wanted it to go on and on.  Two men with a plan for the future discover just how many curves fate can throw in their direction, and they adapt wonderfully.  This is a western that your wife will enjoy as well as yourself;  sometimes the heartstrings are being pulled as well as the triggers.  The images on Blu-Ray are outstanding.","2805":"This is one of the most beautifully filmed and moving stories of all time.Blu-ray only makes it even more beautiful to behold.Both Duvall and Church are superb in their portrayals of cowboys with hearts.This BD belongs in every man's library.","2806":"I am a real western fan and I loved this movie.  It is more family oriented than most and Robert Duval does a wonderful job as usual, acting as a \"good man\" when it comes to all these women he seemingly inherits.  He does the right thing, all the way through.  Recommended!!","2807":"This movie is terrific. A stark look into the old west and how the bad people treated the less fortunate and the good people who had higher moral values. Great job by Robert Duvall and Tom Church.","2808":"In the beginning I was surprised to see what tragic things that those chinese girls went through.Then you are swept away by the changes that Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church undertake with the girls.At first they, are very serious,hard men, but then little by little they start to soften up.Then surprisingly some of the characters fall in love but, it does not emphasize on it. The senery is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking.I also really enjoyed the music.Not only is Broken Trail a very good movie but, also a very good a good story.","2809":"I love westerns, and this one ranks as one of the greatest of all times. Much superior to the over-rated Lonesome Dove. If I could give this 10 stars, I would!!","2810":"I gave this is a gift and them loved it, told me it's a really good movie and can see themselves watching it many times in the future","2811":"Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church make an excellent combination in this Old West seting. Great story line with excellent acting. If you like westerns, you will love this.","2812":"I never get tried of watching Robert Duvall movies.  His sense of fairness and compassion comes across in every part he plays.  Thomas Haden Chruch's performance in this movie made me like him a little more.","2813":"Great Western, highly recommend. Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church both did a great job with this movie.  It had a nice switch with it dealing with them driving horses and come across 5 Chinese girls that they save from being sold into prostitution and many adventures along the journey.","2814":"This is wonderful movie where the cast fits \"hand in glove.\"  Words cannot describe how uplifting, heartwarming and refreshing it is to see a movie that focuses on compassion and care for others such as this, rather than the ad nauseum sagas of the self-centered, surgically \"beautified\" celebrities of today.  Robert Duvall has starred in many movies that depict real people in realistic life situations, always with a villain we \"love to hate.\" MORE PLEASE!  M.L. Paxton","2815":"What a pairing-Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church.  This was an example of intelligent movie making.  So realistic.  Moments of violence and tenderness were indicative of the many contrasts in this movie.  To have the Chinese females as central to the journey was realistic and clever.  After watching this movie many times I regained my faith in the movie making industry.","2816":"Duvall is king, for a western actor. Very well done movie if you like the westerns like I do. Worth a view you wont be sorry for the time spent.","2817":"Broken Trail is a wonderful movie.  Robert Duval and Thomas Haden Church are brilliantly cast as the main characters.  The scenery is beautiful and very picturesque.  I've watched this movie time and time again it is so entertaining and the ending is perfect.  Wish Robert Duval and Thomas Haden Church would pair up in another western.  They were terrific!","2818":"This is a great move. It is an honest rendention of life during this time frame. The charactors are not heros but down to earth people doing what they know is right and just. I highly recommend this move for all family members to watch together.","2819":"I don't care about some western movies, but htis one was excellent to me it is a western with a little drama","2820":"I loved this movie, as did my husband. I think Robert Duvall is a great actor and there was a lot of feeling in this movie. You can bet we will be watching this movie many more times.","2821":"If you love Robert Duvall's westerns, you'll want to own a copy of this classic. Makes one wonder why the major studios can turn out so much chaff, then this indy production (read Duvall production) for AMC trumps so many others. But that was how Lonesome Dove came to be as well. OK, this doesn't have Tommy Lee Jones, Danny Glover or Anjelica Houston, but this sharp Canadian job nails the plot, acting and overall production very very well.  Enjoy it, we did!","2822":"As usual Duval was superb,as was the rest of the cast.I felt I was there.It gave me the sense of the time and space of those early days of the west.A sad story in many ways,but beautifully told, and directed.The scenery was as only the west can be, magnificent! I will watch it many times with great affection.5 stars of course.  M.P. Ormsby. Wollongong.Australia.","2823":"Not quite Lonesome Dove but up there with Open Range as a good yarn, splendid scenery and a usual excellent performance by Robert Duvall. Hayn Church aint bad either. It's no run of the mill western as it has a reasonable story line. Good supporting cast makes it a cut above the ordinary. If you like Duvall and you like westerns then Broken Trail is right up your street.","2824":"ASIN:B000GFRI4K Broken Trail  As usual, with respect to Duvall films this is a great one....It starts out in a beautiful setting and only gets better....It takes place around the turn of the last century....Mr Haden-Church (from TV's Wings) also demonstrated he can also play a serious role when needed....  I highly recommend this film....It hits upon the the subject of bigotry, which was so prevelent in that period of US history....It may be suited for the entire family, but only with adult supervision....It contains adult language, adult content, and violence....  ENJOY, I did.....","2825":"A really enjoyable movie in the same vein as Lonesome Dove, great outdors effects and stunning scenery, the acting is first class, excellent story line, very authentic attention to detail, and to cap it all off an outstanding performance from Robert Duval and all the actors in the movie. All the ingrients of a first class western, certainly gets my vote.","2826":"Wonderful Movie. Great acting, great plot. This was a gift for my husband and we both really enjoyed the movie. Robert Duvall is one of his favorite actors and this was a superb performance. We both enjoy westerns. This movie did have some foul language, crusty old men type, but not an overabundance of foul language; we did however watch in using the Guardian.","2827":"It's not rated but it's not for young kids because of some brief nudity. A big part of the movie is forced prostitution. There's also intense violence. I really wish my sons could watch this because the story is GREAT. Some hardened cowboys come across some utterly helpless young ladies and do whatever it takes to take care of them. This is classic, perfect Robert Duvall. It's gritty and completely realistic. The rest of the cast is good too.","2828":"Good story, terrific script.  Well cast - everyone is really good.","2829":"I was so happy to see this story again and what made it even better was the dvds were in great shape! No skipping, no scratches, no damages what-so-ever.","2830":"An excellent movie with gritty characters.  The action is raw, matter-of fact, sometimes violent. But that's the way life is. The scenery is great. Broken Trail is a long two part made for TV movie so don't get confused when you see the credits rolling half way through.  Just hit the can and when you come back part 2 should be playing. If you like watching horses this is a good movie.","2831":"A very touching, often profound, tale. Robert Duvall has been simply outstanding. And Ah! The landscape made me feel leave everything behind and pick up the trail, sit by a campfire, and talk to the stars. You will like it; a western film with so much humanity is rare. Most western films touch or have touched some mythical need--hero, savior etc. This one does something different--as if it tried to touch the time in tries to portray, necessary ruggedness does not loose the fact that deep down, undercurrent of emotion, tenderness still flows. Good show. Watch it.","2832":"I thoroughly enjoyed the humanity that the story conveyed which was so weel put across by ALL the actors and actresses. Duvall is tops, Haden-Church very good and the chinese ladies were wonderful. The shots of the mountains and general country scenes were uplifting. A great movie I will treasure.","2833":"I haven't seen this DVD, but I saw the mini-series when it was broadcast and agree with all the positive comments -- including that it is better than the more famous Lonesome Dove.  One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that it gets my vote in Movie FanFare's recent \"What's the all-time best movie shootout?\" poll.  I hit rewind on my DVR about four times just for the pleasure of watching the shootout sequence over again -- by itself that sequence elevates this to Western Classic status. Splendidly done!","2834":"received movie broken trail in very prompted time and was in very good shape, made a nice add to my movie collection","2835":"I love Robert Duvall, and believe that the only actor who does cowboys better is John Wayne - but that is probably generational.  This is a two bags of popcorn movie.","2836":"To begin with, you can't go wrong with Duvall and Church together in a western. This movie has it all. Must see and worth buying.","2837":"Another great job by Duvall and Church.  Unique story line and for once a decent ending.  Overall, a really awesome western.","2838":"Broken Trail is now one of my favorit movies. I loved the scenery shown of America's west.  The story is a good one about a man and his nephew who while on their way to sell horses they round up from the wild for the Canadian army, they incounter and rescue a group of young girls from China who had been unknowingly sold into prostituion to a mining camp Madam & her coherts.","2839":"Great cast, good story and great photography make for a winning combination.  Duval is great as usual but so is the rest of the cast, much better than most TV westerns and well worth the time.","2840":"Duvall at his best with a great performance by church.  Great acting all around with a superb story line that \"keep your attention\".  Beautiful western scenery with a good solid positive ending.  Good video and sound.  One of the best recent western. Entertaiing and satisfying.","2841":"This is just a great movie. Mr. Duvall and Thomas Church are just plain excellant in this movie.  Your \"cowboy\" good over evil.  A cowboy does the right thing.  You won't be roped on this one.  Buy it, I'm glad I did.","2842":"EVERY WESTERN WITH ROBERT IN IS BOND TO BE GREAT. HE IS ONE OF THE LAST EXCELLENT ACTORS LEFT. ACTORS WHO CAN PLAY A ROLL WITH SUCH REALISM IS RARE. I WISH HE'D LIVE FOREVER. I MISS JOHN WAYNE AND STEVEN MCQUEEN AND THEIR KIND!","2843":"I borrowed \"Broken Trail\" from my brother. I watched the first disc and couldn't wait to see the second half. Then I cracked the disc while pulling it out of the case. Oh no!  Rules of borrowing: \"If you borrow and break it, you must replace it.\"  I went to Amazon.com and 3 days later I had the second half. The movie case and discs were good as new. The movie was great. The service was great. What a bargain!","2844":"The movie was excellent.  I bought it because none of the rental copies were in good shape and we couldn't watch the whole movie.  When I got my movie from Amazon the beginning of the movie was not in good shape but once we got past the first few glitches it was fine.  Barbara Pryor","2845":"I loved this movie almost as much as Lonesome Dove.  Robert Duvall is excellent, as always. Supporting cast are all very good. Not your average \"western\". I would recommend this movie to anyone who cares for the genre.  I vote it a \"must watch\" film.","2846":"A humble and discretely poor woman , starred by my beloved Italian Actress in any age: Anna Magnani, will make the best she can for her daughter wins in this attractive competition.  Since this very simple anecdote, Visconti will compose an admirable canvas of the Italian Society of the Post War, where unsaid interests will remain behind this apparently innocent election.  Once more the artistic personality and the sumptuous style of this master Director is carved in relief in this magisterial film, one the most reminded pieces of the Italian Neo Realism.  A must-see.","2847":"Here are five frightfully funny adventures with Casper, his friend Hairy Scary and the crime-fighting duo Mini and Maxi. The friendly ghosts travel backwards and forwards in time to deal with prehistoric cavemen and outer space criminals. They teach Mean Muscle McSnort some manners, make an appearance on the Tommy Starson T.V. show, and meet the glamorous Zsa Zsa Amour and the thirsty Count Fatula.  Includes the following cartoons: \"Love at First Fright\" \"Prehistoric Hi-Jinx\" \"The Impossible Scream\" \"Count Fatula\" \"T.V. or Not T.V.\"","2848":"This movie totally blew me away!!!! It has incredible animation, gothic sounds to make the movie feel just right, the scenery was breathtaking, and to top it all off the plot was just amazing!!!<p>Every anime fan dreams about how good their movie would be if everything was perfect - well this is it!!!! Total Perfection!!!!<p>Go see it at the theater!!!! Just do it!!! Now!!!!!you won't regret it!!! I couldn't stop talking about this movie with my friends all day at my job...AND NEITHER WILL YOU!!!","2849":"I've seen this movie in japan the story line mixes old and new traditons on the beliefs with vampires. A great revisal yet new twist for the Vampire Hunter D collections which actually features over 100 stories. great updated CG grafics a start for new breed anime movies. If you liked the origanal 1985 version, you'll love the new &quot;BLOOD&quot; pumped into this one.","2850":"Maybe one of the greatest animation films ever an amazing opening & plot...this film wastes no time & Vampire Hunter D goes through tremendous development as a character...plus the animation looks fantastic & the fight scenes are top notch","2851":"When you see this movie you will think, \"Ultra cool.\"  The delirious pace is one of the best things about the movie, but the characters are also well developed, the dubbing is good, the animation is great, and the situations are surreal and, well, ultra cool.","2852":"Its awesome! Not as great as everyone seems to think, at least story-wise, but still awesome.","2853":"It's an awesome movie. If you like anime, or just animation in general you'll enjoy this movie. Its an awesome movie and an instant cult classic.","2854":"Art wise & story wise my favorite animated movie.  The visuals of the crumpling crosses and arrows falling like rain are incredible.","2855":"This one is no where near as good as the first one, but it's not bad! However, stylistically, it's TOTAL eye-candy. The movie is beyond beautiful.","2856":"Way better than the first.  The quality of animation is incredible as is the action.  The characters are very cool as well.  This movie has gotten me and a few of my friends interested in watching anime but none seem to compare with this movie.","2857":"This anime is definitely NOT childish as stated in some reviews. The character of the movie is hidden in the tiny little things all through it. It does a great job in representing a myth combined with all the flaws and desires in human psyche. Strong, artistic and unique, it remains one of my most favorites.","2858":"i really thought this is one hell of a movie i only bought it because i read a few reviews on here and thought i'll chance it but it's awesome im gonna collect more anime :-) they are well great films :-)","2859":"I've recently started watching anime and yes I have all the essential anime's from Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Ninja Scroll, Jin-Roh et cetera but Bloodlust is my fav out of those.  I'm not a huge vampire freak either.  I'm was takin by surprise by how well this flick was done.  I could go on to explain this movie but  bottom line - just buy it.  you will not be sorry.  Great addition to any collection.","2860":"I liked this anime alot.moth the story and animation is nice. The half human-vamire continues walking,he enters a town that had many vampire hunters, here a woman has fell in love with a vampire count and they all try to free her and clean the place of the rest of demons. Its a horror anime so its not watchable always but its truly a classic.","2861":"First of all, the first one will always be better. The music is one I actually bought the CD for. The acting, great. The voices, great. The animation 50\/10. The only flaw was the exclusion of the Japanese dub. I know it was originally in English, but I''m practicing on saying Japanese, and now watch all my anim\u001b$B!&amp;\u001b(Bin Japanese. But otherwise, a good movie (especially the case, blood red)","2862":"D is back and is already on is way to [stardom].If you have saw the first series you will love this film, it has all that makes an anime brilliant. Re vamped animation and fight scenes that will make you're pet monkey crall to the corner of the room.<p>In other words this is a must see anime.","2863":"This was a great sequal to the orignal VHD. Its different art style and action pacted sceens lead you into the world of D and thase poor souls that live along side the vampire and mutants of a world gone through hell. All in all this film series rates up there with LotR with me as one of my number one picks of all time.","2864":"A word comes to mind when watching Bloodlust: Beautiful.  The animation is superb and there's plenty of action.  D, A half human\/half vampire is hired to rescue a guys daughter from a vampire, simple enough.  But, the movie does have plot twists.  The violence is on par with the oringal, so don't let the kids see it.","2865":"This one is as great as the first. Lots of action and some romance.","2866":"This is one Badd Assss mOvie....It totally Kicks Assss...I have seen the first Vampire Hunter D....but BloodLust takes all the cookie....it is stunningly awesome to watch..<p>To all anime fans out there...Bloodlust is a must have..It could very well be one of the hottest animes in this era....i love animes with gore, action, and violence..all of which Bloodlust has...<p>but don't let 10 yrs. old kids and below to watch it...it is very violent..and a young mind should never bare witness to that...not yet...<p>SssSsssHhoOooTttsssS","2867":"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is breathtaking. It lives up to the promise hinted at in the first Vampire Hunter D movie, and gives the viewer beautiful animation, heart-pounding action, and a multi-layered and engrossing story. Bloodlust stands head and shoulders above it's predecessor, and further develops both the characters and world of Vampire Hunter D.","2868":"The original Vampire Hunter D is an Anime classic, much like Akira.  This sequel is by no means a let down.  The story and animation are excellent.  If you've seen the first Vampire Hunter D, you need to see this.  If you're new to Anime, both this and the origianl should be on your must see list.","2869":"To sum the movie up in two words: Nothing Better! The animation is spectacular, the storyline not hard to understand, and the characters are just perfect. For those of you who want a movie that will fill that empty spot for action buy it now, you won't regret it.","2870":"In one word amazin.g The Cell count on this aniem was so high, the budget so large.. you cant help but oogle evry scene at the impecable detail they added into everey single frame! without a doubt one of the best anime ever. <p>One note tho. NOTE FOR KIDS\/CHILDREN UNDER 16!!! Many bloody scenes, adult scenes (no nudity), and lots of death... but then again.. if you have scene the first D move you will understand.","2871":"... This movie is great, and there's a reason why D's facial expression never changes: it indicates his emotionless personality. The ending wasn't confusing, either; I understood what was going on well enough. The voice acting is the only bad thing about this movie (well, that and Leila), but it's actually much better than most English langauge anime that I've seen. If you liked Ninja Scroll, you'll like this.","2872":"A nice sequel for an all time classic anime. Brilliant animation with a great storyline make this an awesome anime altogether. All anime fans owe it to themselves to get this now.","2873":"I really prefer this flick better then the first movie, the first was good sept this one is a whole lot better cuz of the lengh, good voice overs for the characters, good animation, and a better story. So if u haven't seen this flick yet go and see it cuz it's awesome one of the best animes to come out on dvd this year  so i recomend this to any anime fan or a fan of the original, and also to people who dont watch anime.","2874":"A superior sequel.  It leaves it's predecessor in the dust!  The animation will leave you in awe, and the story will leave you wanting more! Let's hope it doesn't take them another 17 years to make another sequel.  My only complaint about this DVD is that too much of the movie took place during daylight hours.  I think it took away from the creepy atmosphere the director was trying to convey. That being said, Vampire Hunter D : Bloodlust will make a welcome addition to any anime or DVD collection.","2875":"I'm a big fan of the first one. A classic in every sense of the word. But this new one does more than just pay homage... it improves on the animation, and story of our favorite gothic half-breed. And lo and behold, the hand was actually funny! Well, when he wasn't taunting D, that is.","2876":"I liked this better then the first flick , its not the same story its different.Its got a good plot,good length and flow to the story, cool characters,& the animation is awsome. So i recomend this to any anime fan out there","2877":"this is by far the best anime movie i have ever seen!!!!!!!!","2878":"I can only sum up this movie in one word...WOW","2879":"Knowing the difference in time between this movie and the first American release of Vampire Hunter D, I kinda like this one better. I have them both and watched them in a row, but this one just clicked more. If you loved the first one, or are an anaime fan in general you WILL love this movie.....","2880":"Vampires, Futuristic weapons, love, war, Good, Evil....This DVD has it ALL!  Storyline is excellent and original.  Brings an interesting twist to the vampire legend!  A+++++++++ in my book!","2881":"With D, the character of renowned anime status from the original Vampire Hunter D film, ans his symbiotic hand, this was an excellent experience in the theatre. The art is incredible, and the story unique, as well as having the gothic-tech feel of the original. This was, in my opinion as good or better than the original movie, I recommend it highly to all anime fans.","2882":"This movie was pretty good, but it only had a portion of the essence that makes a lot of Anime instant classics and that make you want to watch them over and over. The art-work was fantastic and the scenes were pretty cool as far as action goes. But it is on no level like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, or even the Dragon Ball Z movies. I guess it was story line. It was a good movie, but unless your a Vampire Hunter D fan, this is just a one-watch and done.","2883":"I recieved the movie in a timely manner in the shape that is said it was in which was great. I have no complaints at all it was a great transaction","2884":"A much improved story and the anime was far superior to it's predecessor \"Vampire D\". A very enjoyable feature and worth watching.","2885":"One day I went down to the movie store and rented this movie. I was thinking OK a half-good movie to pass the weekend. I watched it and I was like WOW! The graphics were amazing! O_O Meier Link was one of the coolest characters in anime. And D was just awesome. The plot was amazing as well. I watched this when I was 13.  I strongly recommend it to any anime lover.  I'd rate it for 13 and up","2886":"I saw this movie in the theater (Shocking!). It was sooooo good. The first movie was a bit goofy but this one was great. The plot, the Bishies, the coolness. I would sugest it to any one and every one!","2887":"I just saw the movie today in Austin . I am here to tell you this : I waited two years to see this movie (pathtic no? ) and it was worth the wait . Everything meshed well together . My only complaint is ( unlike most reviewers ) it could have been longer . Espeaiclly when Carmila gets in to the story . That went a too qucikly , but utterwise go see this movie.","2888":"OK NOW I'AM ONLY 13 BUT THIS MOVIE KINKS SO MUCH A** THAT YOU WILL CREAM YOUR PANTS. NOW I KNOW THAT IT IS AN ANIME BUT IT KICKS SO MUCH IT'S MORE OR LESS A 2 ONE THE FIRST ONE WAS OK IT WAS NOT THE BEST BUT FOR IT'S TIME I GIVE IT PROPS.  BUT IN THIS ONE THE VAMPS TRY TO KILL THE VAMP HUNTER.  PLUS THERE IS A LITTLE BACK SIDE OF A WOMEN SHOWING THAT MAKES ME HAPPY ALRIGHT.  SO IN ALL ONISTY I RECOMAND THIS DVD IF YOU LIKE VAMP MOVIES.","2889":"What's hot: -It's a bloody mess -It has some serious ...<p>What's not: -Some of the characters are just plain stupid(yes, you Leila) -A couple of ironic twists<p>What's strange: -Why don't they put some ... in this instead of extreme emotional love.<p>What's the final word: This is among the bloodiest movies on Earth.  Once you watch it, it may make you throw up.","2890":"This movie flat out rocks. Tons of evil characters and heroes that have their own unique special abilities. Almost identical to ninja scroll, but in the Vampire Hunter D universe. Buckets of blood to go along with stunning animation...This is what anime was made to do!","2891":"I bought bloodlust and it just happened to be a japanese import. When I popped the disc in it started playing the original movie. Thinking the seller sent me the wrong disc, I was about to return the movie, but when I stopped it I realized there was a selection for bloodlust!  It turns out both the original and bloodlust are on the same disc!! Incredible, what luck!  All this and I bought it for only 10 bux!! As for bloodlust the movie, it's just as incredible as this disc!","2892":"THIS THE BEST OF THE BEST IN ANIME","2893":"I've always been a big fan of anime, and its somehow the allure of &quot;vampire'y&quot; themes that make such titles interesting. Many fail to live up to the hype, such as the original Vampire Hunter D in my opinion, but this one is just awesome. There's something about D's taciturn nature, and how Meier Link is evil, or is he? Nothing profound in plot, but the action is fast-moving, and if you think hard enough, the usual philosophical themes in almost any anime is there. Excellent anime for the general public, if you don't mind the gore.","2894":"This is one of the best looking animes I have ever seen. It's a great improvement from the first movie and it has some cool digital effects. I'm no spoiler so I'll keep it simple. Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is the sequel to the 1985 cult-classic anime. With more modern techniques in animation, VHD:B is a movie everyone has to see and experience with their own eyes. The monsters are sinister and the fight scenes are action-packed. The DVD has great special features including trailers and a behind the scenes feature. It's a great buy....so why not buy it?","2895":"I went into this film expecting to see some good visual art, but not knowing whether the story would be any good. It was incredible. It had all kinds of begrudging &quot;courtesy&quot; between the competing hunters, and a continuous effort on D's part to appear to be a bad guy, while actually being good. There's also the standard tragic doomed love affair, etc. for the chicks to enjoy.","2896":"Vampire Hunter D: BloodLust is one of the best anime movies that I have ever seen. It has a great story, lots of action, and beautiful animation. If you loved the first Vampire Hunter D, then BloodLust is the anime for you.","2897":"This is a must have for anime collectors. The animation looks great even for an older film. This full length film is meant for the mid-teen to older crowd, for animated violence and gore.","2898":"Vampire Hunter D Bloodlist has got to be one of my favorite anime movies of all the time. The animation is beautiful, the soundtrack is awesome, the voice acting is terrific, the characters and story are original and most important of all... This anime sets the bar for vampire animations. Bloodlust blows the first movie out of the water with ease. D gets more fleshed out in this movie. The real shame here is that there are so many novels for Vampire Hunter D (this movie is based off of the 3rd novel) and so few movies for them.","2899":"Of course the first Vampire Hunter D was made in the 80's, but it was still great animation, anime always is. But, this one is much better, and the story is actually better too. A vampire love story. I'm not giving anymore away.","2900":"Shares much in common story-wise with the original Vampire Hunter D while not being \"just another copy\". More modern graphics style and voice\/SFX and a more involved plotline make this a movie worth seeing for \"D\" fans and non-fans alike. Good ending.","2901":"This anime is one of my favourites. For starters, the animation is unbelievable, so many details, it looks it took forever to animate. And then there's the plot, original, interesting and constantly flowing, just what you'd expect a sci-fi\/fantasy anime to be.  Two thumbs up!","2902":"Wow! This anime was a pleasure to watch from the get-go.  It is dark and gothic and beautifully animated.  It deals with the vampire theme but in a different kind of way....It is like a tragic romantic operetta. Very stylish and the voice acting was good.  Good audio direction and nice art direction as well.  Worthwhile to see with a loved one at your side. :)","2903":"This has everything the first movie had plus more.  This is the same great characterization but with awesome animation.  This has awesome music and a totally kickass opening.  Probably the best opener to any Anime movie I've ever seen!  BUY THIS BUY THIS BUY THIS!!","2904":"Explores the deep recesses of the Australian outback, where these giant creatures still roam the land and rule the waterways.","2905":"Truly liked this informative video.  Nicely made...I recommend it to those who want to know more about flamenco.  Enjoy and...Oleee!!!","2906":"this DVD is very educational. Perfect for the flamenco dancing and musci student. One learns things about the genre that takes years to learn\/understand in the classroom setting.","2907":"I love this show! It's one of my favorites. And this box set is amazing!!! I can't wait for the new ones to come out!","2908":"I was very intoxicated by this series. It is incomplete though. But if they add another season I'll buy it in a heartbeat. -Jult Warfell","2909":"This movie was amazing. I watched an interview dvd with the doors prior to it, and this was taken exactly from what they said. Every inch of this movie was from the mouths of the real people, so accurate and he really looks like jim alot in this.","2910":"this video is a must have for anyone who enjoys the doors. Val Kilmner's portrayal of Jim Morrison is the best thing that he has ever done. you will swear that he is posessed by the spirit of Morrison. Meg Ryan as Pam completes this tale of late 60's drug crazed rock and roll. Get it you won't regret it.","2911":"This is a great movie. If you like the doors or EVEN if you dont like the doors it's still great. It has a lot of the doors songs on the movie and  also great TRUE facts although some are false. If you haven't seen this  movie I advise you to.","2912":"This movie is really great. Val Kilmer deserves am award for his portrail of Jim Morrison. All the actors that played the Doors were awesome because Val really sang and the other guys really played their instruments. If you love the Doors and Jim Morrison then you will really love this movie. Also with the help of the remaining Doors Oliver Stone made this movie true to life and according to the facts.","2913":"what can i say, a classic movie about a classic rock band on high def blue ray.....get it.","2914":"Great music, great concert camera work, and great acting by Val Kilmer. The only real negative is the focus on Lizard King persona, and not enough real Jim. But overall worth watching w\/ the volume set on high.","2915":"This was the part that Val Kilmer was born to play. The music in the movie just makes you trip away from the very beginning. It's fantastic. I love the Doors. This is a must have for any Door's fan.","2916":"Great movie and performances from all.  Not sure why he didn't get a nomination.. must have to any collection","2917":"This is a great quality product and quick shipping. The movie is great depicting the era of the great rock n roll bands. This type of musical talent no longer exists in \"today's\" bands.","2918":"This was a wonderful film, ValKilmer's best in my opinion. As Jim Morrison Kilmer gets to the core of the inner and oft hidden demons with all of us.  Although achieving wealth,fame and success Morrisson is haunted by a mystical figure who appears to be calling him toward his destiny a destiny which Jim seems so eager to meet and embrace.  Morrison personifies all that was rock and roll in the 60's , sex drugs and seeminly a taste for pushing ones'self to the limits of physical and psychological exhausion.  I highly recommend this.","2919":"you love oliver stone or hate 'em but for this viewer The Doors defines rock music in the 60s better than any other movie. it's a stone trademark to get career-defining performances from people and in this case Val Kilmer gives one of the best performances of his career. Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison is uncanny. The music is used artfully and the editing is fantastic. The only false note is the casting of meg ryan as Morrison's wife. Otherwise a beautiful immersive movie.","2920":"If you love The Doors, you need to watch this film. It's absolutely amazing. Full of many songs from The Doors and other bands of the era, it paints a picture of the band from the very beginning until Morrison's death. Val Kilmer gives an outstanding performance and slips into the role of Jim Morrison with no problems. You're tempted to think it IS Morrison. Meg Ryan is wonderful as Pamela Morrison.  I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of The Doors. I can't get enough of it.","2921":"Looks brand new, not a scratch on the DVD. One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $3!!!","2922":"Oliver Stone is a crazy nutbag and has gotten worse over time but Val Kilmer deserves major reconition for the best preformance he's ever given.","2923":"Having lived through the era in which this takes place, all I can say is WOW trippin' down memory lane!!!","2924":"Highly entertaining film about the Doors rise to fame.  The music is great.  Not to be missed.","2925":"This film takes you through the history of the Doors starting in Vanice Beach California where they break through and rise to stardom.  Perfectly cast Val Kilmar as Jim Morrison and his girlfriend Meg Ryan take you through the wild, ride of the life of Jim Morrison and his band.  Along with the evolving music of his band and the rising drug addiction that influenced the future of his life. It flows through the timeline showing all the true aspects of Jim's poetic personality.  Fabulously portrayal of Jim Morrison and very entertaining.","2926":"Although I have never agreed with drug use at all, I have always enjoyed the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors. (and many other groups of the 60's and 70's)... I also love the acting ability of Val Kilmer, and he is awesome in this role. The movie is very well made, the music is fantastic, the storyline is wonderful, yet so sad... I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doors...","2927":"Brilliant. The film starts out with The Doors, and then takes on a life of its own, becoming a cult object in the process, an objet  d'art, breathless, entwined, twirling, obsessive, relentless, varicoloured...It's like a sex act that feels unbearibly good and creates expectations of a final, musical, passionate, finale.","2928":"If you just want to have a good time and not worry about details related to biography, this is the perfect The Doors movie.","2929":"this movie made a Doors fan of me &amp; the new edition has lots of extras &amp; 5.1 sound.  I think Oliver Stone did a wonderful job for the most part with this movie; looks so realistic which I think was one of the great things about this &amp; JFK.  Val Kilmer gives the performance of his career &amp; I think the whole cast was great.","2930":"This was a good show in all. Very Trippy!! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it?? heehee! Billy played &quot;Kat&quot;. He had brown long hair and was on crutches. He was briefly at the bar. Be careful... if you blink, you'll miss him!! :o)","2931":"(Blu-ray version) For only those, who just like me, when look for a review, they only hope to find technicals opinions, nothing about the movie, history, critical or something like that, so... The picture is great and the sound is great too. Buy it!","2932":"If there is any thing bad about this movie is that it does not go on forever and ever.The life of Jim Morrison is one story that can never be portrayed in words or pictures but this effort is worth a praise.Though it does not really shows what a good company Jim was but it do keeps you goin through the worst parts of life.If you really wanna see why this man was and still is a mystery,You must watch this movie.","2933":"This movie transported me back to the 60's. It brought back some great memories. The sound track is excellent!!!!!","2934":"Amazing movie... fun to watch and a total trip. (Seriously, this movie gives me a contact-high every time I watch it!)  Val Kilmer is really great and of course the music is awesome.  Oliver Stone is quite the visual weaver.  This is a great film for anyone interested in the Doors - and if you're not?  This film will GET you into them.","2935":"This is one of Val Kilmer's best movies.  If you didn't know you would actually believe he was Morrison. If you haven't seen it you need to and if you dont' own it you should especially if you are a Doors or a Kilmer fan. I give this movie two thumbs up.","2936":"...Mr. Kilmer is dead-on as the Lizard King, the &quot;band&quot; nails the look of a band really performing and the trippy visuals are all in the spirit of the era from which the Doors sprang. Man, either rock or get the hell out of the way ...","2937":"This Movie is awesome it was beautifally directed by Oliver Stone and has the best cast ever! This movie Explores the dynasty of one of the greatest bands ever THE DOORS! If you are a big fan of the doors like me you will love this movie! It goes from rise to fall a perfect movie a MUST SEE DO YOU HEAR ME A MUST SEE!THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I AM THE LIZARD KING I CAN DO ANYTHING!","2938":"This movie changed my perspective of Rock n' Roll intensely.  This movie was so gratifying, it gave me chills, it also made me sort of understand Morrison more.  Val Kilmer portrayed  such a terrific roll as Morrison, I acually believed it was Morrison instead of the actor.  I love the doors.  I dont think the movie could be any better or any worse.  Thumbs up to Oliver STONE.  JIM MORRISON LIVES","2939":"This told the story about The Doors through their years up until Jim Morrison died sadly. It gave me a whole new look in the band. Val Kilmer delivers in the great role as one of the best rock and rollers of our time. The Doors have some of the best songs out there and it protrays on how some songswere written. Great DVD..Buy it! I did, It was worth the money! A++","2940":"This movie was excellent. Val Kilmer played Jim Morrison impeccably. This movie really gave me a look into The Doors and really entertained me. I'd Reccommend this movie for anyone who likes The Doors or music from that time. I enjoyed it, before the movie I didn't know too much about Jim Morrison or The Doors but now I am a Doors fan. This movie is a must-see","2941":"Val Kilmer's extraordinary portrayl of rock legend Jim Morrison is timeless. The film has progressively become a cult classic because of it's chaotic yet introspective tale concerning The Doors and Morrison's rise as a legend.","2942":"This movie is a very insightful look into the Doors and Jim Morrison's life. However, if you really want an accurate history I would read Riders on the Storm by John Densmore.","2943":"I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job, the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim, to an older one, was unreal. Meg Ryan also great in this. The music, acting, the story was very entertaining, this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time.<p>Great Job Kilmer!","2944":"As a huge Morrison fan, I have to give Oliver Stone credit for being one the major influences. This isn't supposed to portray The Doors accurately-it's Hollywood, not a documentary. It's merely one person's vision with theatrics thrown in for good measure. That being said, if you love absolute and utter chaos (as I do) in rock and roll format, this is a must-see.","2945":"The Doors is one of music's most enduring rock groups, led by one of the 20th century's most interesting personalities Jim Morrison.  The movie, directed by Oliver Stone, is not a biopic, more of an \"homage\" to the life, and the character of Jim Morrison.  The movie details his life, and his rise and fall in music, culminating in his death at 27.  The DVD features the same features from the earlier Special Edition, including Oliver Stone's commentary.  Included are 43 minutes or so of deleted scenes and a couple new featurettes.  Highly recommended.","2946":"I think this is a great movie. They did a pretty great job with the sound and everything. One thing i didnt like was that some of the opinions in this nivie were different from life. For instance, when the doors appeared on cbs, they were asked not to sing the line \" girl we couldnt get much higher\". As most know, Jim sung it anyway, but it was an accident. Stone made it appear as it was on purpose. Also that one of the other members was made to look like he hated Jim, ehich was not true","2947":"Oliver Stone an ex Vietnam combatant, a Doors music fan, made an estrordinary work , a great vision of the sixtiees and Jim Morrison's life, great preformes, a worthy Doors movie. Not recomended meet the doors with this movie, is only the vision of a fan.","2948":"Kilmer is Morrison in this movie, he acts and feels out what the man did and how he saw the way he did. This is a big winner and I like The Doors myself and this was a good one. Hooray for Oliver Stone for making this awsome movie. Long live Morrison","2949":"I loved this movie. Val Kilmer played a killer Jim Morrison...very impressive. Almost true to life. There were some slow parts but all in all this is a great movie!!","2950":"I am a John Wayne fan & have over 70 of his movies in my collection.  I agree with Mr. Wu's description of the plot.  It is one of the better of John Wayne's grade B Republic movies.  It is the only movie in which John Wayne \"sang\" & the dubbed in voice is definitely not John Wayne's voice.  John Wayne did not want to be a singing cowboy & it allowed others like Gene Autry & Roy Rogers to fill that role.  I was pleased that the film was reworked & the DVD had good audio & picture.","2951":"Bob Hope was essentially the official Presidential comedian for generations - and this DVD is a great look back at his good-spirited ribbing of many administrations.  It shows how political humor can be funny without being devisive.","2952":"The DVD was for my daughter and she loved it, she is a history buff so this was really fun to watch.","2953":"When you've had enough Heads Up 7-UP and you're 5 minutes early to go to lunch or to leave at the end of the day just pop in Schoolhouse Rocks! I use the DVD when we finish a lesson a little early and there is not enough time to start another one.  It's kind of funny when the kids (2nd grade) randomly break into song on the way out of the building in the afternoon... The favorites this year were 3 is a Magic Number, The Preamble, My Hero Zero, and in the last weeks of school Conjunction Junction","2954":"I bought this for my grandson who is 5 so some of this is for kids older but he has enjoyed parts.  I think he will get much more out of it when he is a little older.  I do recommend it as a learning tool.","2955":"My kids in Kindergarten and 2nd Grade  love the video.  They are already humming the tunes.  It is a good idea to start them early!","2956":"I am satisfied with this material, as a teacher.  My huge complaint is that there are too many advertisements at the beginning of the DVD that you are forced to click through, which is very time consuming. Teachers don't have time.  Teachers don't have a lot of money either.  So, to purchase a product with advertisements is disconcerting.  We purchase DVDs for the material.  We shouldn't be paying to be forced to click through advertisements.","2957":"...and we're so happy!\"<p>This DVD is a lot of fun.  Being a 30 something myself, I grew up watching these on Saturday mornings.  It's fun to review them now and to watch my son enjoying them as well.  It's great family fun and education!","2958":"Great. A little difficult to navigate the selections to get to the title you want, but nostalgic and fun...","2959":"Too many of our youth in high school haven't heard of anything on this CD. If something works don't fix it. This has been the greatest way to explain anything from a Senate bill to an adjective.","2960":"We love Schoolhouse Rock.  I have a 7 year old, a 5 year old and a 2 year old and we all love to sing along to the educational songs.  It has opened conversation between the big girls and me about parts of speech, math and American history.  We love it!","2961":"I bought this set because it reminded me of my childhood. I played it for my kids and they loved it as much as I did. The animation isn't as crystal clear as what is produced today, but it's fun and lively and educational.  And if you aren't careful, you'll be humming parts of it all day long at work....  \"Interplanet Janet, she's a galaxy girl....\"","2962":"i enjoyed watching these fun and entertaining cartoons. brought back so many memories. i bought this for my granddaughter. she will enjoy it as much as i did growing up and as an adult also!","2963":"I grew up with these as a kid and now I can share ALL of them with my children.  Some clips are a little dated but on the whole this is more fun than I even remembered.  In the age of Sponge Bob and Bratz it is nice to see that children can be engaged by even complicated concepts if they are delivered in clever and imaginative ways.  You'll be humming the songs for days.","2964":"This is a great DVD to enhance your child's understanding of concepts learned at school.  However, I don't recommend sitting down and watching it all the way through like a regular movie.  Not knowing this, we sat down to watch the 'movie' after receiving the DVD.  After several 'lessons', we felt a bit bombarded!  It would be much better to only watch 2 or 3 target lessons,discussing concepts during or after.","2965":"This series of short videos is a great tool for parents to teach their kids various topics, English\/Grammar, Math, How our form of Government (should) work, and History.  I remember it well!","2966":"Finally, every one of the Schoolhouse Rock -- as well as a few I don't remember.","2967":"This is a good video for kids.  It worked for me along time ago.  I learned the preamble from this video and to this day if I need to recite the preamble I sing it.  Not only the preamble, you learn spanish, bill to a law, conjunctions.... this video is timeless.  If you have kids get this for them, makes at least the basics for 5 subjects in school easier for them.","2968":"Awesome collection of all the videos and then some!!!  I use this to assist my teaching in Science, Social Studies and Language Literacy.  The kids remember the catchy tunes that I learned from 30 years ago!!","2969":"Wonderful childhood memories...I remember watching these same stories\/songs on Saturday morning and then singing until my family was annoyed enough to ask me to stop! I remember learning \"I am just a bill\" and some of the content actually helped me pass my government class- gotta love that!   I love this DVD and would recommend it highly!","2970":"What a great time I have watching this dvd. I have flashbacks of Saturday morning cartoons.  Anyway, my kids love it and have learned a lot and don't even know they are learning.  I think it is set up great.  You can play them all or you can pick and choose which you would like to watch.  I can go right to the shows without having to go through any advertisements.  My 8 and 5 year olds love it.","2971":"I grew up knowing most songs from Schoolhouse Rock.  This DVD really brings back memories.  And more importantly, the lessons that are learned by the end of each song are way cool.  Perhaps I am stuck back in my childhood days; but I am looking forward to sharing this with my 1 1\/2 year old daughter.  Each song has a way with sneaking in something educational without the child realizing the true value.  Before you know it, your kid is singing along and saying \"Hey! This is taught in school.\"","2972":"This DVD was awesome!! The songs are so fun and yet the kids learn a lot.  My son was so excited because he was able to easily pass his math test by humming a few of the songs!!","2973":"\"I'm Just a Bill\" helped me pass my US Government test a year after ABC dropped the series.  I still know the preamble to the US Constitution in truncated form thanks to \"We the People.\" I'm not sure I would have passed the class without SHR swimming in my back brain.","2974":"I ordered this for my neices and nephews, they loved it. Thanks a million. From my understanding my sister said they really enjoyed it. They are going around singing the songs.","2975":"An absolute must for anyone with small children. Covers basic math and grammar as well as science and history, all delivered in musical jingles that are easy to remember for children. The only negative about this collection is that for some reason the volume level is extremely low, probably either poorly mastered from the original source or a poor conversion from the original mono broadcast. Even with the poor sound quality this gets four stars, fix the audio and it would get 10 stars.","2976":"Whether you are buying this for yourself to reminisce about times gone by or you are going to use it as a teaching tool (I'm using it for both as I'm in my late 30s & grew up on School House Rock), this DVD will not disappoint.","2977":"Took me back to the '70's... Saturday mornings on ABC... I have told many people during high school and my working career (and still to this day) that whenever I have to remember the Preamble to the Constitution, I sing from Schoolhouse Rock. I remember having a history exam in H.S. and singing this in my head!  Do you remember The Great American Melting Pot? I'm just a Bill? The suffrage movement? 5,10,15,20,25,30...?  I think that this was one of the best educational vehicles created to teach diverse material to my generation and beyond. My daughter loves it!","2978":"I bought this for my kids seeing how they have no other cartoons like this anymore.  This brought back memories of my own childhood.  Would recommend this for any parent with kids.","2979":"This DVD covers a lot of subjects that kids actually learn in school. This is more for 1st to 5th grade. Its very informative so do not expect you can watch everything in one sitting. I just wish they can do more updates and cover a lot more subjects. This is worth it!","2980":"Just what I wanted watched it with my daughter and she is already singing the songs I am sure she will learn from this dvd","2981":"My husband and I were given this set as a gift when our sons were 4 and 2, and I think we have had more fun with it than the kids have. I remember watching these growing up in the 80s and it's amazing how many things I learned that stuck with me through the years. We love every minute spent watching these. My kids are starting to watch them and ask about the things they're learning. Good stuff!","2982":"This is the best set of short educational cartoons ever made. I've never seen a child not be memorized by them.  Buy this","2983":"I loved these songs as a kid, and now my 6-year-old is singing them.  These songs make learning grammar so much fun.","2984":"This DVD is a great blast from the past!!  I grew up with these videos in the 1970's and I forgot how funny (and generally educational) these videos were.  It's great to see them all again whenever I want.  How wacked is the video about the U.S. spreading to the west coast because we needed \"elbow room\"?  I don't think the Native People would appreciate that one.  I was disappointed in the extras.  Otherwise awesome!!","2985":"I'm a teacher of adults, some of which speak Spanish. Putting the parts of speech to music helps them learn.","2986":"I ENJOYED SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK growing up.  I still remember the songs today at 43!  I thought the catchy tunes would help her with multiplication.  She has been listening to the whole thing over and over.  I enjoy revisiting the songs too.  This is a great tool to add to your arsenal to make learning fun.","2987":"This DVD is in excellent condition and my children love it, not to mention the memories it brings back.  Schoolhouse Rock should still be run on regular TV.","2988":"I'm so Happy that they were able to get all of the School House Rock Series on One DVD. Hooray for Technology! School House Rock is a gem. If you have children, of your own, I strongly suggest sharing this with them or, if you're a big kid like myself, get the DVD for yourself and stroll down memory lane!","2989":"I remembered plenty of these great songs, but there are some newer ones too.  They are just as engaging as I remember.  Fun, catchy tunes entertain all ages.  My young boys loved them as much as I do.  You'll hear engaging favorites like Three is a Magic Number, Conjunction Junction and Interjections!.  I highly recommend it.","2990":"I couldn't believe that this one inexpensive disc could have all of the videos from all of the areas. I stand corrected. It's all there, though the menu is a little wierd. Good buy!","2991":"It has all the episodes and the kids are just mesmerized just like i used to be.  I especially like the math songs and to be able to put subtitles on is priceless.","2992":"I remember these shows from my childhood. I bought this for my son who was having problems in math.  Now we BOTH sing the songs about math, etc.  Our favorite: Conjunction Junction!","2993":"Wow! I love this DVD. It brought back so many memories for me when I used to see it on tv and now I can share it with my children.  It's a great and fun way to learn.  I was surprised to see how many songs I remembered.","2994":"This is a great! If you watch this with your kids it can really help them get interested in learning about things that otherwise would be really BORING! But even after they know the songs you will still have to explain to them what they are singing. It is a Great learning tool!","2995":"My daughter (9 years old) loves this video and we now share this common connection. I'm one of the millions who grew up with these educational music videos. I'm glad that I have the chance to share with the next generation.  One minor issue with the video is the difference in sound level between the Disney advertisements at the beginning (loud!) and the part of the disc you really want to see (much softer.) Other than that, the sound and video production is fine.","2996":"This DVD is phenomenal. My sons love it. They used to play Schoolhouse Rock on ABC every Saturday morning in between the Saturday morning cartoons. As a kid, ABC educated us without us knowing it. The basic rules of grammar, math and U.S. history that I learned from Schoolhouse Rock, I was able to use in school. Children nowadays need more of this and less violence. Schoolhouse Rock can be incorporated in elementary school education.","2997":"School House Rock is classic.  It teaches some basics in grammar, math, history, government, etc (all in a catchy way that kids grab on to).  These \"commercials\" were one of the few ways I personally enjoyed learning about grammar as a kid. Too bad they don't still air them - or make new ones (especially as many school systems do not seem to think teaching -and enforcing - grammar is all that important).","2998":"I bought 2 of these one for me to keep and one for my family and it is everything i had wanted. I was skeptical cause i wasnt sure if it had every skit but it does and ones i hadnt even seen before. It was well worth the money","2999":"This video is wonderful. It has all the clips I enjoyed when I was a kid and some new ones that are equally entertaining and educational.  My five-year-old loves to watch it and it has already helped with our math facts and singing other parts of our assignments."},"label":{"0":"negative","1":"negative","2":"negative","3":"negative","4":"negative","5":"negative","6":"negative","7":"negative","8":"negative","9":"negative","10":"negative","11":"negative","12":"negative","13":"negative","14":"negative","15":"negative","16":"negative","17":"negative","18":"negative","19":"negative","20":"negative","21":"negative","22":"negative","23":"negative","24":"negative","25":"negative","26":"negative","27":"negative","28":"negative","29":"negative","30":"negative","31":"negative","32":"negative","33":"negative","34":"negative","35":"negative","36":"negative","37":"negative","38":"negative","39":"negative","40":"negative","41":"negative","42":"negative","43":"negative","44":"negative","45":"negative","46":"negative","47":"negative","48":"negative","49":"negative","50":"negative","51":"negative","52":"negative","53":"negative","54":"negative","55":"negative","56":"negative","57":"negative","58":"negative","59":"negative","60":"negative","61":"negative","62":"negative","63":"negative","64":"negative","65":"negative","66":"negative","67":"negative","68":"negative","69":"negative","70":"negative","71":"negative","72":"negative","73":"negative","74":"negative","75":"negative","76":"negative","77":"negative","78":"negative","79":"negative","80":"negative","81":"negative","82":"negative","83":"negative","84":"negative","85":"negative","86":"negative","87":"negative","88":"negative","89":"negative","90":"negative","91":"negative","92":"negative","93":"negative","94":"negative","95":"negative","96":"negative","97":"negative","98":"negative","99":"negative","100":"negative","101":"negative","102":"negative","103":"negative","104":"negative","105":"negative","106":"negative","107":"negative","108":"negative","109":"negative","110":"negative","111":"negative","112":"negative","113":"negative","114":"negative","115":"negative","116":"negative","117":"negative","118":"negative","119":"negative","120":"negative","121":"negative","122":"negative","123":"negative","124":"negative","125":"negative","126":"negative","127":"negative","128":"negative","129":"negative","130":"negative","131":"negative","132":"negative","133":"negative","134":"negative","135":"negative","136":"negative","137":"negative","138":"negative","139":"negative","140":"negative","141":"negative","142":"negative","143":"negative","144":"negative","145":"negative","146":"negative","147":"negative","148":"negative","149":"negative","150":"negative","151":"negative","152":"negative","153":"negative","154":"negative","155":"negative","156":"negative","157":"negative","158":"negative","159":"negative","160":"negative","161":"negative","162":"negative","163":"negative","164":"negative","165":"negative","166":"negative","167":"negative","168":"negative","169":"negative","170":"negative","171":"negative","172":"negative","173":"negative","174":"negative","175":"negative","176":"negative","177":"negative","178":"negative","179":"negative","180":"negative","181":"negative","182":"negative","183":"negative","184":"negative","185":"negative","186":"negative","187":"negative","188":"negative","189":"negative","190":"negative","191":"negative","192":"negative","193":"negative","194":"negative","195":"negative","196":"negative","197":"negative","198":"negative","199":"negative","200":"negative","201":"negative","202":"negative","203":"negative","204":"negative","205":"negative","206":"negative","207":"negative","208":"negative","209":"negative","210":"negative","211":"negative","212":"negative","213":"negative","214":"negative","215":"negative","216":"negative","217":"negative","218":"negative","219":"negative","220":"negative","221":"negative","222":"negative","223":"negative","224":"negative","225":"negative","226":"negative","227":"negative","228":"negative","229":"negative","230":"negative","231":"negative","232":"negative","233":"negative","234":"negative","235":"negative","236":"negative","237":"negative","238":"negative","239":"negative","240":"negative","241":"negative","242":"negative","243":"negative","244":"negative","245":"negative","246":"negative","247":"negative","248":"negative","249":"negative","250":"negative","251":"negative","252":"negative","253":"negative","254":"negative","255":"negative","256":"negative","257":"negative","258":"negative","259":"negative","260":"negative","261":"negative","262":"negative","263":"negative","264":"negative","265":"negative","266":"negative","267":"negative","268":"negative","269":"negative","270":"negative","271":"negative","272":"negative","273":"negative","274":"negative","275":"negative","276":"negative","277":"negative","278":"negative","279":"negative","280":"negative","281":"negative","282":"negative","283":"negative","284":"negative","285":"negative","286":"negative","287":"negative","288":"negative","289":"negative","290":"negative","291":"negative","292":"negative","293":"negative","294":"negative","295":"negative","296":"negative","297":"negative","298":"negative","29
