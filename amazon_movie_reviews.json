{"sentence":{"0":"Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".","1":"If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.","2":"My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.","3":"I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.","4":"The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again","5":"This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.","6":"Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!","7":"I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.","8":"It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again","9":"No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.","10":"I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive.","11":"I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.","12":"I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.","13":"These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.","14":"Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.","15":"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.","16":"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.","17":"Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport. Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?","18":"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on.","19":"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can.","20":"Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. It is only for people who like herbal taste. I don't.","21":"This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described. Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date. Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing","22":"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest.","23":"Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(.","24":"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money.","25":"I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a \"good\" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have \"Masa corn flour\" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.","26":"The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3\/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container.","27":"I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?","28":"So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note...","29":"I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth.","30":"Taste like it is stale.  Will not order this again.  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee.","31":"Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it.","32":"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and\/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?","33":"These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.","34":"My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!","35":"I haven't used the ham base. It is loaded with MSG. I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item","36":"This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.","37":"Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, it's that bad.","38":"Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable.","39":"A vile, miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I don't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk, baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Nature's Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage.","40":"I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different. Will never buy these chips from here again.","41":"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor.","42":"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt\/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!","43":"It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.","44":"I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.","45":"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite.","46":"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could.","47":"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy.","48":"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame.","49":"after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?","50":"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same.","51":"Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily, crunchy, flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now they're no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P., Kettle Brand chips. :(","52":"...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging \"peanuts\". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great \"premium\" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!","53":"These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!!","54":"I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.  It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.","55":"I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER TUSCAN 3 CHEESE N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS  THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.  I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.","56":"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.","57":"If you are looking for STRONG S\/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S\/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S\/V flavor these have \"just a touch.\"","58":"These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy.","59":"Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can.","60":"DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark\/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well.","61":"I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it.","62":"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called \"Vinegar and Sea Salt\" - not \"Sea Salt and Vinegar\".","63":"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me.","64":"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.  Yuck!!!","65":"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market.","66":"I Was sent 3 week past \"Fresh by date\" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.  EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.  Very bad form amazon.","67":"I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?","68":"I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.","69":"I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12.","70":"\"Yeast Extract\" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing \"No MSG\" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.","71":"I did not like these potatoe chips. It's hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. It's also a bit salty.","72":"Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: \"supreme\" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the \"supreme\" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully.","73":"Well, I opened it and it is grayish sticky mess. I'm so mad at myself for wasting my money, and not trying to make it from scratch at home. Which would probably end up better and cheaper. Oh well, live and learn!","74":"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this.","75":"I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c. The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake. It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible","76":"My husband and I were very disappointed in this coffee, very weak, watery cup of coffee. A definite waste of $13.00.","77":"This item, WERTHER'S SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY, if consumed, will give you - or your friends, loose bowels. I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem: You can't return them. Need a laxative? I have ten unopened bags you can have - for free.","78":"This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear it's not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical.","79":"The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it. No other item inside our fridge turned bad.","80":"This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes!","81":"this isn't as easy as it looks, doesn't came with enough yellow frosting, and the frosting doesn't stick very well. My 5 year old did like making it though.","82":"I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be bigger. Also, it did not come with enough icing. I had to use my own.","83":"The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says \"Use By\" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!!","84":"This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell: terrible.  It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.  Well, one tea bag was enough for me.  My mother-in-law said, \"Oh, that smells kind of like wine.\"  Okay, kind of like wine, with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste.  If she likes it, she can have the whole box.","85":"Trident \"Strawberry Twist\" sugarless gum is very disappointing, both in taste and consistency. The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets \"stringy\" fairly quickly.  I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.  Not Recommended!  CFH","86":"The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.","87":"Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.  If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.  Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA.","88":"Not my idea of a good caramel.  Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated.  Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. I missed the mix of rich, buttery, dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels.","89":"I can't eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them.  My kids also think they taste funny.  My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own!","90":"I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly. The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and doesn't taste as it should. Many of them stick together, and whenever I want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it.","91":"The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.","92":"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free.","93":"Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.","94":"The first ball worked pretty well, it just looked a little beaten up.  Since then, ~half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water (all of them do after sitting for a bit).  If you don't mind the rate of failure, the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time (especially considering that it is white tea).","95":"Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earth's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earth's best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business.","96":"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon.","97":"Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture. Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.","98":"To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.","99":"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!","100":"I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.  My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.","101":"I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree.","102":"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.","103":"Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you're looking for hot this ain't it","104":"I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it: Jalapenos Water Vinegar Brown Sugar Lime Juice Fish Sauce Cilantro Habanero Garlic Spice Blend Salt Potassium Sorbate Xanthan Gum","105":"Ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. This one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. Not going to buy again. Im still on my search for the salty dry version im after","106":"The noodles in the box were all broken.  The sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor.  I threw out most of the skillet.  I would recommend not purchasing this product.","107":"Recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients, then I read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup.","108":"Coffee beans did not seem fresh.  No oil on them what so ever.  I have tasted much better and fresher.  Will not order again.","109":"Tossed this out after trying it.  Texture and taste were far below expectations.  Seemed kind of mushy and pasty.  Pricy to boot.","110":"My cookies were in such tiny broken pieces ,they were useless. Upon complaint, a second mailing arrived several weeks later. The cookies were again in crumbs. The cookies were packed in  a box with a pitiful single air bubble. I gave this feedback and expected some effort to improve on the packing. But no, same packaging, same useless cookies.  Having enjoyed these Highlanders in the past, it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money.","111":"Was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday.  Seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them 'safe'.  :-(","112":"All my fault. I thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal.  Instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. Who sells cereal for this price plus $8.00 shipping ? I feel stupid!  Buyer Beware!","113":"I ordered both the beef and Turkey flavors. My dogs would not even take these in their mouths. Both flavors were  very dry and had no real aroma to them. Try a small quantity first. i  donated the entire order to the Humane Society.","114":"This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- who will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, where is a zero star button?","115":"We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the same Seasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!","116":"After reading all the good reviews on these chips I have to admit I was disappointed. Perhaps I just ended up with a bad batch, but I could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt (and I mean BLACK) chips in these bags. Hopefully the other flavors are better, but I'm going to stick with other brands from now on.","117":"These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray!","118":"The flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good.  However, the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty, and thickly encrusted with it. The flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes.  Messy and unpleasant.  Needs lighter flavor coating.","119":"Be careful!  I ordered a pack of 6, my invoice says pack of 6, but I received only 1 stick.","120":"Even though the item says \"Pack of 6,\" I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust what's on Amazon now???","121":"My cat will NOT eat this food. I don't know why, but it was a waste of money. I was looking for something cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.","122":"I like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby's pancakes.  It does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff.  It is rather bland in my opinion.","123":"Items in this Gift Basket was delivered to people who called me to say \"could not eat any of it, because everything was old and stale.\"  I was sad and disappointed. Time and effort, as well as money to get this, only to find out - terrible.","124":"Very disappointed with purchase.  The dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates.  Must have been sitting there for a long long time.","125":"I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed.","126":"This vendor is unscrupulous. She ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. She has no conscience and I would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere.","127":"I don't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough.","128":"I purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business.  When they arrived, it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper \"MADE IN CHINA.\"  NO WAY I'm giving these to children if they were manufactured in China, following the whole poisoned pet food debacle.  The fact that these are made in China needs to be highlighted much more clearly.","129":"These lollipops are not as pictured. They came in assorted colors, some really drab, not the rainbow brights shown in the picture. They are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap. I need them for a birthday party and I was really disappointed when I received them.","130":"I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area.","131":"This muffin mix is awful,..all you taste is flour and sour cream,.which is used to make these.  It just tastes wierd. I've tried and tried,.. there are no good tasting low carb \"treats\",..esp. for diabetics.","132":"Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did!","133":"Where's the ingredient list for this product?  Thought all foods were supposed to have it.  Would never buy any food without first knowing what's in it!","134":"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear \"flavor\". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing.","135":"This was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs. Maybe my dog is just spoiled, but she treats these like third class treats- it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy.  More often than not, she will simply walk away from these.  Glad other people like them, but I will not be buying them again.","136":"I remember well the \"Beer Nuts\" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of \"Beer Nuts\" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask \"Beer Nuts\" ... 'What happened?'","137":"I ATE BEER NUTS ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD YEARS AND INTO MY 20'S. AFTER THAT YOU COULDN'T BUY THEM IN UPSTATE NY. WHEN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM, I CHECKED OUT THE NET TO FIND THEM ON YOUR SITE. THEY ARE HORRIBLE. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. THEY TASTE MORE LIKE SPANISH PEANUTS WITH OUT THE SALT. THE BEER NUTS I REMEMBER WHERE SWEET AND SALTY, JUST LIKE THE LABEL SAYS. THESE PEANUTS ARE BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.","138":"The flavor of the old Beer Nuts is almost entirely gone. The Beer Nuts are now just plain Spanish Peanuts with a slight flavor, hardly noticeable. Extremely disappointing.","139":"It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.  Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a \"whole lot of shaking\".  Most of the \"coating\" and \"flavoring\" was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are \"sealed\", it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot, humid day.","140":"This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing.","141":"I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess \"to each his own\" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)","142":"This was my favorite stevia product and I had it on subscribe and save until I queried customer service about NuNaturals GMO use.  Yes, NuNaturals uses GMO products.  SO, I've canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001ELL3U0\">Stevita Stevia Clear Liquid Extract, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 3)<\/a>.","143":"I bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. The other night I decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. It was so bad I couldn't believe it. It wasn't spoiled, it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste. It didn't even taste like caviar. I threw the jar away.","144":"I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed!","145":"This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it...","146":"Caviar taste awful. Maybe it's because I bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it? Why do people like to waste money on these things?","147":"i found this product doing a search for \"edible gold leaf.\" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked \"NOT to be consumed\" and \"for decorative use only.\" so this is a misleading product.","148":"Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of \"Chicken\" but the horrid taste even overshadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog.","149":"the taste isn't good, at least isn't good for Japanese and Chinese. Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste. Plus the price isn't competitive.  I'd suggest Asians never buy it.","150":"The noodles for this product are what make me gag.  I am not a fan of this meal at all and I &lt;3 Asian food.  For those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100% vegan - I would either A) go try 1 first or B) skip buying this package as it is not delicious.","151":"I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did.","152":"This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old?? Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy.","153":"I never got the product and complained about the non receipt.  so i bought some in the store. klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf","154":"makes nasty loose poo! the dry food does the same thing. i've tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools.","155":"I have purchased locally many other flavors of Da Vinci syrups, and ordered blueberry online to try it, because it isnt available locally- and I love blueberry! Well, this was a disappointment to me- very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor; not to mention I paid 4x what I would pay locally. #very disappointed","156":"This coffee is absolutely horrendous.  I cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees.  I cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  The best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals.  I am really bummed I cannot returned this.  A complete waste of money.  It all went in the garbage.","157":"The flavor of these pods is horrid.  I ordered them only because Senseo was out of stock for so long, and I needed some decaf pods, and these had received a couple good reviews (which I now suspect were written by Baronet employees).  I have never tasted such awful coffee before. A big \"YUK\" for Baronet.","158":"how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding... the order told you to send me the COOK & SERVE choc.fudge pudding.... you show the picture of it.... why couldn't send it to me.... it makes me wonder if I should order anything else from you.... pissed","159":"I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it.....","160":"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.  Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors).","161":"Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product.  Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information.","162":"I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...","163":"Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!","164":"I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice.","165":"I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup. They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.  They like the dollar store dog food better than this.  Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.","166":"I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!","167":"Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips..","168":"Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up.","169":"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better.","170":"Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Can't be returned.","171":"OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some...   I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHO'S!   Just not for me!","172":"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her.","173":"I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.","174":"Pop Chips are basically a horribly over-priced version of \"Munchos\" which are baked potato chips and have been around forever. Period.","175":"I bought these chips thinking that they are \"all natural\" per their description of \"No preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors.\"  When I received them I checked the ingredients, and they contain \"yeast extract,\" which is synonymous with MSG (yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid).  I will never purchase this product again.","176":"the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so","177":"I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money.","178":"These chips are too salty!!! I like the crunch, size of the bags, and variety. But i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are.","179":"The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I won't be buying this again for lunches although the size\/packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., weren't really kid-friendly).","180":"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories.","181":"I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.","182":"The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out. I keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side).","183":"Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half).","184":"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb\/vegetable\/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better.","185":"I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldn't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldn't get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height.","186":"The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question.","187":"After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w\/ their response.","188":"This product was a complete disappointment. Tastes like mushy pineapple. There was no papaya taste.","189":"I will never buy this item again!! I was addicted to it until the last order!! Fruits had foul smell, tasted rotten!! Was the expiration dates forged!?","190":"I purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices. i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis. i was pretty disappointed. the juice is very strong. i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini. the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice. it was way too salty. the olive juice was over powering. i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1\/4 part olive juice. i would not recommend this item.","191":"Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website.","192":"This product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important!  I prefer to drink my Grey Goose straight; however, on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice.  This product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice.  It's not worth it!!  The after taste is worse!!","193":"Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!","194":"This candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all.  I ended up throwing most of it out because I don't like so much sugar.... I prefer strong flavors like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001KYOENE\">Altoids Twin Pack Mints, Wintergreen 2 tins<\/a>  The center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it's an anise seed.  But there are better licorice candies out there like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0029JTZLK\">Twizzlers Twists, Black  Licorice, 1-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)<\/a>.","195":"I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler. In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf.  But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the Amazon warehouse deals section.  All the k-cups had a best used by date of 6\/2012.  I was happy about that atleast.","196":"My husband just bought a Keurig coffe maker. In the box was samples, his favorite was Donut Shop. I ordered the 35 K-Cup for him. I was so disappointed, out of the 35 k-cups 11 were decaf, giving me 6 k-cups of each of the 4 flavors. I also ordered the Wolfgang Puck sampler, I got 12 flavors 4 each. How cool is that! I would order Donut Shop again, just not the sampler.","197":"I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the \"sampler\" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or \"the lack of variety\" pack!","198":"I got this on the warehouse deal so I wasn't expecting much. However, be advised you will get NO regular Donut Shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf. I love the flavors of all of these though, so that's ok. But I will think hard about getting another variety pack.","199":"Didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima's from Dominicks. The pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable, but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup.","200":"This expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake.  A less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste, no doubt.  It's a yucky product.","201":"This mix produced some pretty bland pancakes.  Followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes.  Considering the ingredients that needed to be added, it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch.  I debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters I have left (maybe some pumpkin pie spice) but that won't help the thicken up the batter.","202":"Makes OKAY pancakes. Only marginally better than the standard Bisquick recipe. They are edible (I should say that my kids liked them).  Not that great, in my opinion.","203":"We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.","204":"What am I missing?  This mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. I've tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. I use real maple syrup on top. I cook them in fresh bacon grease. The pancakes are still, just, blah. It's like they absorb and negate the flavors.  The pancakes cook ok. The texture is fine. Just absolutely no flavor.  Won't get this again. Considering pitching the rest of what I have.","205":"Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think it's completely misleading to substitutes with products that don't pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING!","206":"I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.","207":"Really Amazon?! Nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of EGG NOG... and when I am not craving Egg Nog in the summer, it's Gingerbread I'd really like... don't buy this, it sucks... I'm probably just going to toss it. If there was the ability to rate this with a negative number... I'd say -3","208":"I do not consider Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog, Caramel Apple Cider, Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!","209":"I was hoping for the gift box, instead I got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of K cups.  Don't get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box, not a warehouse box.  It looks like a mix and match of K Cups that fell out of other packages or were returned. Buyer beware.","210":"I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers, original, all natural.  Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I can't eat it.  This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered.  Apparently I can't return the box of crackers.","211":"I bought this because it's organic cheese puff. My son love Gerber cheese Lil' Crunchies. I thought he may like this too. I subscribe it once a month. Now there is 4 cans not open. The idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great, but there is no taste for this cheese snack. There is no cheese flavor in the puff. My son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me. My son love Happybaby's yogurt melts, beef stew, happy baby banana beet blueberry and Spinach, Mango and Pear. This cheese puff does not work for him.","212":"This flavor is awful! We absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao & maca is really difficult to get down. I give all the other flavors 5 stars!","213":"I had heard this was wonderful canned food, so I tried it for my very fussy schnauzer. I was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when I opened the can....I scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry....and she sniffed it and walked away. She does seem to like the Merrick BG dry food. I chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner.","214":"I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food.  Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store, evidently.","215":"Just got my teabags today, and the first bag I made tea with... the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping.  The bag remained intact though. The second bag, while unwrapping the teabag... the tag ripped the bag right open.  The tea tasted fine, not very strong like most other oolong teas.  The quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material.  Two out of two broke... I guess I need to be more careful with the others.","216":"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!","217":"I had high hopes for this product when I first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing.  The food was easy to prepare at my workplace.  However to me, the taste was very oily and flavorless.  I'm a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor.","218":"I love peanut satay.  This product is truly terrible.  In no way does it resemble that dish.  Oily, salty and tastes lousy.  Don't waste your money on this brand.","219":"Very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected. Very runny, actually. There are better brands out there.","220":"Hi,  My first grandson was born and I wanted everything under the sun to celebrate!  This is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time!  HOWEVER......everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just weren't fresh.  These little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock!  The moral of the story is that being a \"fun\" item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves....at least they could have been fresh and not hard.","221":"I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet.","222":"ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption. Easy return process.","223":"The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w\/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.","224":"Buyer beware! The label on the Amazon site clearly states \"D.O.P Certified\" but the product received does NOT match the site label and does NOT state \"D.O.P. Certified\" This is bait and switch and I will file a complaint with Amazon.","225":"You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive \"CERTIFIED\" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware.","226":"Since a DOP product is not readily available at my local grocery stores, I got really excited when I saw the photo of this product at the Amazon website because the photo states that this product is \"D.O.P. Certified.\"  But when I received the shipment, it was a huge disappointment.  It was a different product than what the photo promised.  (I can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily.)  Very disappointing.............","227":"I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes. That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up! Terrible presentation for an expensive item. As an aside, none of the cans I received has a \"DOP CERTIFIED\" label but only \"CERTIFIED\" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???","228":"The can that is shown says D.O.P. certified but when my relative ordered them from Amazon.com, the cans that were shipped only indicate CERTIFIED. One can buy these non-DOP at any Walmart. What do they mean by CERTIFIED? Certified as to what?  Unfortunately, the venders are making fools of Amazon.com. As a consequence, I am staying away from Cento products entirely. Fool me and Amazon once, shame on Cento; fool me and Amazon twice, shame on me and Amazon. There is no way I can make this review FUN!","229":"these are not DOP they're just \"certified\" which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write \"department certified\". real dop tomatoes are much better.","230":"They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.","231":"I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again.","232":"The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not....","233":"Merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise.  3\/4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not DOP Certified.  They sent me lower standard merchandise.  Received full refund from Amazzon.","234":"Of the 12 cans shipped 11 of them had very, very serious dents in them. I'm not talking dings, I talking serious dents.  So dented that I truly thought of throwing them away.  My husband stopped me though because at $5 a can he felt that it was too wasteful.  In my local grocery store, items this dented are put into a reduced price bin, because they usually don't move otherwise.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002C4HZ00\">Cento San Marzano Certified Tomatoes, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)<\/a>","235":"It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.","236":"Do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup??? i used this until i realized that. i switched to gerber, its so much better for your baby.","237":"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work.","238":"I bought this same brand from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products.  I was able to turn it into cream\/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah brand of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless.","239":"I was disappointed when I received this dispenser.  It said a large dispenser.  It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his \"man cave\".  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item.","240":"I found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. If I cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt, it was OK. Would not order this flavor again.","241":"Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.","242":"The treats were ok,my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.Which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.One treat just di not do it.This package should be labeled for toy or small dogs.","243":"Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.","244":"Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.","245":"I ordered this item in a large quanity, but wanted the items packaged as shown.  They were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees.  When they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose.  If I had know they would come like this I would have gone to COSTO or some other discount store for the purchase.  The cute little box that would have helped make them special and what I thought I paid for was missing.","246":"When tea is decaffeinated, is all the flavor removed? Or is this just lousy tea? In any case, all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a (12 oz.) mug of hot water is--hot water! True, the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping, but there's no tea flavor at all. Very disappointing.","247":"If you are ordering cookies, beware, the 'cookies' arrived in crumbles, so, if you want a box of stale crumbs order away :)","248":"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!","249":"Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and I've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. The only way I can make it palatable is to put it over ice, add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. I've got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help.","250":"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste.","251":"Honestly, I'm not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews.  It's a little weak but mostly just doesn't have a rich flavor.  It is really missing something.  I drink coffee black.  Maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar?  Before buying this coffee, I had been drinking Starbuck's French Roast and Folger's Black Silk, both of which taste SO MUCH better than this coffee.","252":"Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!","253":"Ugh....I tried this as a replacement for the Coconut Water with Pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program.  This stuff is awful.  It's got added sugar, which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross.  Never getting this stuff again.  (And I do love coconut water, in general, as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than Gatorade...well, usually.  Not this stuff.)","254":"Almost gagged at first taste. I have used other coconut based products (water, milk, cooking oil, etc) and this is the first time I have been disappointed. My teenage kids hated it. My son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he couldn't stand it. I am sure Done is not the healthiest, but one you try that, there is no comparison in flavor tolerance.","255":"I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water.","256":"Sojo's diet lacks calcium, and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog.  This diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium\/phosphorous additive to be safe.","257":"If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.","258":"The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup.","259":"It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again.","260":"I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry.","261":"Saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. Opened can. Heated soup. Tasted soup. Dumped soup down drain. Rinsed mouth with mouthwash. Enough said.","262":"As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different brands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh.","263":"This is one of the worse tasting soups I've ever eaten. I hated it, and now I have a full case.  It tastes bitter to me, and my husband wouldn't even try it.  Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter!","264":"I wasn't thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel. The flax seeds themselves were fine, top quality. If it weren't for the gravel bits (that get through the sieve w\/the seeds, I guess?), this would get 5 stars.","265":"Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.","266":"This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan\/kosher.  Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?  Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.","267":"Mrs. May's should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. I won't be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. Do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in China. Totally frightening what they're getting away with.","268":"I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!  How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your baby's mouth, or your pet's mouth??!!!","269":"I expected the flavor to be more like that of \"brewed\" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although I'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldn't order this again.","270":"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.","271":"I wasted a little over $15.00 because the reviews were so good. This has no taste cold or hot. It states to use 16oz of cold water. Well, I used just a cup and it didn't work out for me. I tried adding more packets and it helped but very little. I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup of green tea--, or I am missing something here. I do not recommend this tea.","272":"This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.","273":"The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.","274":"This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.","275":"I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.","276":"This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant.","277":"I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great.","278":"When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.","279":"This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was \"natural flavor\"  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.","280":"We purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all! It was expensive and not worth the money.","281":"I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?  Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really.","282":"I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it.","283":"Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped.","284":"Popcorn has grear color (white)  But taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product, I would not buy again.","285":"This is  terrible popcorn! No taste, poor popping ratio. and the size OMG! I popped this Gourmet popping corn in front of a party, everyone busted out in laughter!","286":"Do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. One cup of popcorn will have 1\/2 cup of  un poped (old Mades) kernels left over which is unacceptable.This is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck, so I recommend staying away from this one.","287":"Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1\/3 hull, 2\/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls. I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull.","288":"the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn.","289":"This popcorn has alot of hulls I order 4 bags and can't stand to eat it it's so hully - terrible","290":"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!","291":"worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.  gave it to the birds for bird food.  postage was outrageous!  just not a good experience all around.  wont be buying from them ever again.","292":"This \"Baby White\" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a \"whirlypop\" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again.","293":"wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING","294":"I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though I'd like to rate it a \"0\"- this item still shows in stock, but clearly isn't, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.  Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck!","295":"I'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews.  This was the most bland chowder I've ever had.  I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing!  Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing.  Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.  On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too.","296":"Bits of \"Clam?\" (not sure) in water with something I assume is potatoes. Whose recipe is this? save your money get something worth having. How do so many like this?! It's awful! If you prefer REAL Clam Chowder and not seawater with something floating in it DO NOT buy this!","297":"I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money.","298":"We opened a can of Bar Harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder.  There were mostly potatoes.","299":"Tried this yesterday as a \"treat\" on a cold, rainy fall night.  It had an unpleasant, grainy and somewhat watery texture.  The clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky, for lack of a better term.  The flavor was also very lacking...it didn't really taste like, well, anything.  Definitely not worth the price.  I can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for Bar Harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder.","300":"One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box.","301":"I ordered this Pack of 20 1-pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal. Well....  1st, it's not 20lbs of tea, I received only 1  2nd, it's not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves you'd expect from lipton  Strangely enough, I ordered the non-decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesn't taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, I'd like to know about it. Maybe I'll try again.","302":"This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker.  In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my \"fur kids\" products from China. If it happens again, I'll stop ordering all Smokehouse products on-line.","303":"This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right.","304":"According to an article on CNN.com on 8\/5\/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable. \"Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.  The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.\"","305":"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how \"good\" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!","306":"This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity.","307":"The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still haven't updated the product description.","308":"I emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato, and they assured me that they'd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center.  However, the ones I received did not and I feel like I was lied to by customer service because they didn't want to take the time to actually check into it.","309":"I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks..","310":"Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.","311":"These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these \"thin crisps\" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.","312":"To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these \"thin crisps\" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.","313":"These things are low cal oreo's: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title \"oreo\" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase.","314":"Well, when I bought this item....I thought it would be a direct Japan import.  It is Taiwanese. It was bought at Costco and resold....(the price label was still the product.)  The product can be bought at Costco for half the price...if not less.  The expiration date was not printed on the product....which makes me think it was expired. I believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough..  Will shy away from this product.","315":"This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.","316":"Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.  I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.","317":"Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked.","318":"I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong!","319":"I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again.","320":"The shipping was very fast, but so was the expiration date.... got it on Feb. 14, 2012 expiration is April 4, 2012 (only 6 weeks before it expires).  Who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time??????  I should have returned it, but who wants to go through all the trouble.  Well I stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable.  That's what you get when you order food online.  I will not order it again!!!!","321":"I was disappointed when I received this shipment, as the seaweed contains MSG, and it's not listed as an ingredient. Amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase.","322":"My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. It's WAY overpriced here.  It is an excellent coffee - I'm drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste that's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts.","323":"I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasn't too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites.","324":"I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away.","325":"The chocolate cake is fantastic, so I had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case.  It was very dense & tasteless - totally unlike the airy, tasty chocolate. I want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix.","326":"I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong!  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a  waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. They do not put fragile on the box outside.","327":"If you want the best wild rice, buy the regular kind. This \"quick cook\" type is not near the taste quality of the regular\/ 40 minute cook time rice.,","328":"I love these cookies, they taste exactly like Oreos. But unfortunately, every time I eat them (2 cookies at a time)I get horrible headaches and migraines (which I don't get from real Oreos) Its obviously caused by some of the 'nutritious' ingredients. Another thumbs down---they include vitamin K which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners, or for anyone middle-aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned---vitamin K can cause blood clots. HEADACHE & MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE of these cookies!","329":"We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.  We contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining, they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us.  We never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again.  Very expensive and no quality.  Stay away from this company.  We lived in Spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like.","330":"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money.","331":"first off, i love whole wheat products, and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch (and no it wasn't expired, i checked the date) but my mom and i just had some of these and we're not fans. they had an oddly fishy\/grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets. O_o","332":"I've been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them. They are darker green than usual, which was not a problem, but the texture was chewier and the flavor wasn't as good. This is a problem since it's the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues. The taste & texture were so different he was gagging. Not pleased with the change.","333":"Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon!","334":"I drink 10 cups a day of Verona, Italian, or French roast coffee, and wanted to try a lower-acid version. This brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar. It is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you.","335":"This coffee tastes so nasty I can't even drink it. It's disgusting. I can't believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags.","336":"Flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee, but I decided I'd rather take massive doses of Pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill.","337":"I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry, it needs some more moisture-don't buy it unless you want really dry bread.","338":"White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me.","339":"Three of us tried it; one of us was barely able to drink it, with ice.  I guess this is, like Evian, an \"acquired taste.\"  Unless you're able to try a single bottle before purchase, I recommend you pass.","340":"I have a recurring shipment of this product each month.  Every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and VERY mangled.  Last month one of the cases of water had to be repackaged before it arrived and it was a day late.  I suggest using a more sturdy box for shipping.  The water product is fine ... it's just the shipping packaging I have a problem with.","341":"Somehow my previous review got deleted. I live in Houston, TX. I buy lots of bottled water-cannot tell any difference between a bottle of Talking Rain and a glass of cold tap water.","342":"Do not buy this if your thinking its only mango.  Ingredient says \"Fruit Juice Blend (Organic White Grape Juice, Organic Apple Juice And Organic Pineapple Juice From Concentrate, Organic Mango Puree.\"  I cancelled order as soon as I realized this drink had grape and pineapple.","343":"Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved.","344":"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?","345":"I found this too sweet. Am hoping there's an unsweetened version available. Not very chocolatey too, kinda like Swiss miss.","346":"It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise.","347":"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning\/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.","348":"I was hoping this was a good idea.  However we tried them even after I heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true.  Not the same as the stuff from the can.","349":"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior.","350":"very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting","351":"I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was \"diet\" or \"low calorie\".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.  Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products.","352":"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug. Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup","353":"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better.","354":"Just plain nasty!!! This item tasted like cardboard, very watered down and no flavor to it at all.  Very disappointed","355":"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add \"creaminess\" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug.","356":"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away.","357":"I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews.  The artificial sweetener taste is awful.  I gave two stars only because my husband doesn't seem to mind.  I can't drink this- even if they were a bargain.","358":"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting.","359":"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food.","360":"I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.","361":"The artificial sweetener ruined this for me... It leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband, who drinks diet soda, even noticed. At least it wasn't pricey.","362":"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money.","363":"This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Don't think they are sold on Amazon yet...","364":"Had I known this cocoa was sugar-free, I would not have purchased it. I realize that this will not bother some people, but I really don't like the aftertaste of fake sugar.  In the interest of fairness, this did not seem to trouble my nephew!  Just update the description.","365":"My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again","366":"Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people.","367":"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise.","368":"I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products.","369":"This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.","370":"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting.","371":"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of \"This Stuff\" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this \"SLOP\"!","372":"I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients.","373":"Please stay away from artificial sweetners.  Some of them actually change the shape of human cells.  this has an artificial sweetner","374":"I've been excitedly trying every type of K cup I can get my hands on since I got my Keurig for christmas and, until now, have not encountered any that I truly hate. Until I discovered this one. I would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at Grove Square certainly did a good job. Not only was the hot chocolate watery, but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also. Yuck!","375":"I ordered this specifically b\/c they said \"dark chocolate\" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!","376":"I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct \"plasticy\" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.","377":"This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.","378":"I ORDERED THE DARK HOT COCOA IN HOPES IT WOULD BE REAL CHOCOLATEY AND IT WAS NO BETTER THAN BUYING A POUCH OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND ADDING IT TO HOT WATER. I ACTUALLY THINK THE POUCH ADDED TO HOT WATER IS LOADS BETTER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER!!!! V-E-R-Y ...D-I-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-E-D! FOR THE PRICE...IT'S A RIP-OFF!","379":"The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(","380":"this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients. NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.","381":"I can't believe I didn't check out the ingredients for this.  I never would have bought it if I would have known there was artificial sweetener in it!  First cup though, I got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote.  If you don't have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems, you may like it.  Not worth it to us.","382":"Found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too.  They complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging, so we switched back to packets.","383":"We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.","384":"Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didn't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste.","385":"Thought I'd try these because it's a good price, but the chocolate flavor is not that good. And the sucralose taste is very strong. I like the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate ones better, even though those have sucralose too, you can't really taste it.","386":"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!","387":"We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again","388":"We bought this to replace our Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa.  They are less expensive- but you get what you pay for.  This cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste.  I do not recommend it.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B005K4Q1T0\">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Dark,Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count<\/a>","389":"I love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack, however, these are gross.  Horrible after taste, my kids dont even like them.  Now I have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink.  Very disapointed.","390":"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.","391":"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!  I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack.","392":"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck","393":"INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, GLUCOSE SYRUP SOLIDS, COCA (PROCESSED WITH ALKALI), PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL (MAY CONTAIN COCONUT, SOYBEAN, SUNFLOWER, PALM AND\/OR CANOLA), NONFAT DRY MILK, MODIFIED WHEY, MALTODEXTRIN, SALT, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, CELLULOSE GUM, SODIUM CASEINATE, CORNSTARCH, LACTOSE, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SUCRALOSE, MONO- AND DIGLYCERIDES, SILICON DIOXIDE, SOY LECITHIN, ARTIFICIAL COLOR. CONTAINS: MILK AND SOY  People, please read labels....","394":"there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.","395":"If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.This has artificial sweetener (sucorse)  just like the other hot chocolates out there.","396":"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.  I do not recommend this product.","397":"I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody","398":"I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.","399":"Arrives $15.06 postage due in a used Friendly 's box. UNFRIENDLY don't you think? Worst service ever!!!!!_Totally unfriendly! !!!aweful aweful aweful service!","400":"Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.  Checked the expiration date and it wasn't expired.  Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.","401":"Cracker Jacks were horrible--stale, not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired","402":"Becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them, they expire quick. I can't use these, I ordered them to use in my November wedding but they expire in March :(","403":"Original description and order said \"Assorted\" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get.","404":"These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.","405":"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented","406":"What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps.","407":"The box has only pasta and dried-up sauce. No TUNA!!!  If you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box, it says, \"Just add tuna\".  So the products is making a FALSE CLAIM !!! Shame on you, Annie.","408":"I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.  $28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box\/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.  On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks.","409":"I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.  It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.  While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard\/chewy.  I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it.","410":"This is not a 20 oz bag.  It is only 4oz each bag.  Misleading product.  Thought I was buying 20oz bags.  Not very happy.  Should've gone local for 8 dollars per bag.","411":"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left.","412":"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great.","413":"These came out smaller than I expected, but the taste as not as good as I thought it should be.  Second time, I added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix.  I thought it would save me time, but I like my own muffins better.  My husband thought they were okay, but not great.","414":"I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know it's not a kitchen error and I'm not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamela's brownies--add extra dark chocolate and they're delicious as \"brownie bite\" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1\/2C applesause instead of oil!","415":"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money.","416":"I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense. If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag. In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing.","417":"I really didn't notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot.","418":"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again.","419":"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee.","420":"These have an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Not pleasant. I would not purchase them again. This the first Kcup hot chocolate I've tried, I'll keep looking.","421":"This product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date!?!  I don't know but I'll not buy this again.","422":"These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Haven't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig","423":"After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier.","424":"This one has a major problem. It's waaaay too watery, even at the recommended settings. The chocolate flavor is okay, and it's not overly sweet (although it still isn't great dark chocolate flavor). The really issue is that there isn't any creaminess, and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. Blech! I'll pass, and I'm throwing the rest of the box out.","425":"Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them.","426":"My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix.","427":"I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.","428":"I went to check out and found out that the freight is $14.00 on an $11.00 (canned, not fresh produce)??!!  RIDICULOUS!!","429":"Although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod.  The cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery.","430":"My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.","431":"To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf. What happened to Senseo decaf?","432":"I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.","433":"I can get it at Walmart for $1.78 each or the gas station for $3.50 for 2. Why, just why?","434":"Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glazier's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like.","435":"the product was advertizes as hot sausage;s. the lable on jar say;s [ hot sausage ]. but they not even warm . the sausage;s do have agood flavor but just pickled. we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for year's so i know what i'm talking about.","436":"While I gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit.","437":"I ordered this prouct along with 2 others. I bought all together to get the \"FREE SHIPPING over $30\". What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time.","438":"I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1\/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please.","439":"I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of \"sensitive skin\" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.","440":"This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.","441":"It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best.","442":"I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. It's Amazon's fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever.","443":"Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.","444":"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.  These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies.","445":"tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.  it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape","446":"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said \"Blech!\".","447":"After eating TANG's chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Horton's, Timothy's, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn!","448":"Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this?","449":"I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing.","450":"The product that I received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item's page.  The worst part of it all was that when I attempted to return the case of \"Soy Crisps\", I was unable to do so.  Amazon said that this was a non-refundable item.  So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of \"Soy Crisps\" that I will not eat.","451":"Just plug and play with your preferred software.  No hassles, worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working.  Didn't drop it (It is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather - feels cheap).  It just stopped working.  When I buy a product I don't just want it to work great for three months.  Totally dissapointed.","452":"Owned two of these and when they work they are fine.  The power knob has no indicator on it though.  My biggest problem, and the reason I will NEVER purchase another, is this: both gave out with in a year.  One now sounds like I am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option.","453":"Great audio, until a few months in it just decides to stop working. Common problem: google it and you'll see. Cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world. Feels like a fast food toy.  I do not recommend this product. Piece o' garbage.","454":"Cheap: A plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside.  Never worked right; no user interface, no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power.","455":"I was told by the salesman at Guitar Center that the Icicle was easy and very high quality. . .  It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Haven't been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . .","456":"I find that even with the gain on maximum, the volume is not very loud.  I use it with a Shure SM57 mic and my Macbook (using Audacity).  One must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly.  When I use the Shure mics with a mixer (the \"analog\" way), there are no volume problems.  It is simple to set up, being almost \"plug and play\".  You have to choose the input source.","457":"the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue","458":"I have several different ways of connecting XLR microphones to my computers for use in webinars, and I thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect, but when I tried to use it with a Shure SM58 mic the volume it produced was about 25% of what I am used to, and was not adequate for my purpose.","459":"I had this product for literally only a week, and had only used it one time. When trying to use it again I found that it wasn't sending the sound through. When I plug it into my PC, it recognizes it and the icicle lights up, and i select it as my recording device, but then when i actually try to record, it makes no sound at all (and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it's not that) This was a complete waste of money, unless there's an easy fix that i'm missing...","460":"this does not work on windows 7, tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din't work. This was a waste of time and money. Be aware of this issue.","461":"purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged. customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it.","462":"Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. 'Nuff said!","463":"I wanted to like this product, as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs, but it didn't work well at all.  Very noisy.  Lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices.  Considering the decent reviews by others, I may just have a defective unit.  Either way... it's going back in the mail today.","464":"I bought this before I purchased the MXL Micmate. It is plastic, and very cheaply made. I felt like it would break very easily, and would not be something that would last me a while. So then I bought the Micmate. It is solid metal, and is way better sound quality than this. I beg you to buy that over the Icicle. Buy the MXL used (Like New) from \"TheMintMovieMan\", a great seller and it is a great product. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000VZ8WC2\">MXL MICMATEC XLR To USB Preamp for Condenser Microphones<\/a>","465":"I used the icicle for about two hours. After taking a break, I plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. I did everything I could think of to fix this, even hours of searching google. Nothing. In the process of a return. =\/ It would've been perfect if it just worked.","466":"It works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  With dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  Works with Windows, not with Linux.  The build is very cheap.  Anything more than $5 for this is too much.","467":"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!","468":"I was hoping Bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.  I made both biscuits and dumplings (chicken & Dumplings). The biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. The dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two.","469":"I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  I've used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  I've found much better options.","470":"Second ingredient is SUGAR! Need I say more? Make your own bisquit mix, it's super easy!","471":"I made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best.  I really tried to like this product, but the taste is just so far off -- for me.  I wanted a break from making things from scratch, but this just was not worth it.","472":"I ran out of Pamela's mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had.  I followed the pancake recipe on the back.  As a person with celiac who has tried many things, I knew when I saw the fine, crystalline mix it wasn't going to be good.  The batter is pasty looking.  The pancakes were too dense and slightly off.  The end product was pretty bland.  You will be much better off with Pamela's mix.  Pamela's can be served to a gluten eater; I cannot say the same for this product.","473":"The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000EYC096\">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz<\/a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.  I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth.","474":"I made the waffles and was not impressed. Definitely not worth the expense!  It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops. I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.","475":"Thought I had died and gone to heaven when I made the bisquit recipe.  I was wrong! Went to indigestion hell.  I had serious hope for this product. I truley loved the mix, but it didn't love me.  I haven't had indigestion since I gave up gluten until I ate a bisquit from this mix.  Best luck on getting it right bisquick.","476":"My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better, but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste, I would buy again and make my crust very thin.","477":"I bought these for pancakes, and I haven't used it to make any other recipes, so I cannot speak for how it makes biscuits, or any other item. But for pancakes, it's a no-go. They have a hint of pancake-flavor with lots of butter & syrup; but I don't like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup, so these pancakes are NOT for me. Moving on to other mixes...","478":"When I saw the ingredients on this box I knew it would be a disappointment. It would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. Also, there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like Pamela's and Bob's Red Mill. This will be a huge disappointment to you so don't waste your money.","479":"Was awful. The sight of this in my pan made me sick...smells like POTATO  duh potato starch)...would not brown. My child laughed the entire time...as I complained because I was so hungry and thought I could have a late night pancake session. Totally not the case.  Yes, I am a GF newbie... I tossed the box!","480":"Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.","481":"A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.","482":"I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin...","483":"I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free. However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a brand new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!  This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didn't publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON. I will not be purchasing this item again.","484":"Now if you could just make it sugar-free also?  I know, I don't want for much.  :-)<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004391DK0\">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)<\/a>","485":"The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes.","486":"I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!","487":"Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough.","488":"Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram","489":"These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture. They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.  I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website.","490":"Apparently 'regular' size = thinner than standard-sized pencils =(  My chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes, when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick.","491":"The ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason.  They are brown, mushy, and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist.  On top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar.  No living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul.","492":"I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  I'm still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products.","493":"In the past I was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix. I made 2 rum cakes today thinking I had done something wrong when the first one didn't turn out as usual. I now realize I didn't do anything wrong,Duncan Hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product; I would gladly have paid more for the larger mix. Now I will never buy another Dunkin Hines Mix!!!!! How dumb do you think we are.","494":"While I think this product is good, I'm disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz. Has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight, the 6 looks very much like an 8.  Same size box, less product, hmmmm.","495":"I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product.","496":"Maybe, I got a bad one.  It's very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again.","497":"I made one for my daughter's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good, though.","498":"\"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.\"","499":"Be advised. You will only receive 1 (one) box. They are less than $3.00 in the local grocery store. Will not purchase again.","500":"This product was absolutely horrible!  Each and every bar was obviously old, because it was stale, smelled awful, and had to be thrown out.  Shame one you for even trying to sell such a product!","501":"Four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken. The product is apparently not able to be returned, so I just wasted 55 dollars.","502":"One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.","503":"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again.","504":"B U R N E D  I read the other two reviews and didn't heed their warning. That's on me.  They are 'usable' but they were certainly burned.","505":"I can't believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive! You should take this product off of your product list. Worst product i've ever ordered","506":"I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.","507":"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes.","508":"Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive.","509":"The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.  I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.","510":"I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as \"coffee tasting\" or with \"roasted flavors,\" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this \"roasted\" flavor.","511":"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash.","512":"I also bought two of these as gifts, and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others.  Unacceptable packaging!  Unless you have already tried the product, there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it.  I assumed (big mistake!) that there would be some kind of packaging, but there was not.  This is really sad too, because the product is great.","513":"I purchased this as a present but it doesn't come As shown in the picture.  It is little white bags with the flavor written on them.  Someone receiving it as a gift wouldn't even know what it was unless I explained it to them. Will be returning.","514":"I bought this for a Christmas gift, but I will be returning. There is no box or packaging as pictured, it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes, which would be fine if I was just buying for myself but not for a gift.","515":"The Ener-G English muffins that I received from Amazon were not of the same quality when I buy them directly from the distributor in Seattle.  They crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible.  Also, there were only 4 in the pack instead of 6. I had to cancel my recurring order.","516":"The Ener-G Foods English muffins look good in the packaging, but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom.  This presents a gooy feel in the mouth, and both my husband and I got stomach aches.  Won't be buying this again.","517":"These english muffins are okay at best.  They are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast.  They definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise, do not taste the best.","518":"If you are looking for  English muffins - go to the grocery store and buy them.  These do not even resemble English muffins and are tasteless.  However, if you are on a restricted diet (wheat flour, soy, dairy, gluten,etc.) these might be for you - check the list of ingredients.  I didn't care for them at all.","519":"I tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll, I couldn't cut them without falling apart!  I ended up toasting them in pieces, more like chunks, and with enough cream cheese, they were only OK!  Tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products I would recommend!","520":"These are not the greatest.  Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come.  Not so.  They were not what I had expected.","521":"Come on Amazon, give me a break.  Powdered tofu?  Get in some real food and I'll buy more from you. I went looking for table sugar. You've got 100 weird kinds of sugar (that you expect me to buy in bulk!) but NO just plain sugar. I'm not eatin' any more of this rice and tofu bread either.  Sorry I just had to rant.","522":"DO NOT BUY!  REVIEW ONLINE!  Looks like another treat made in China with multiple reports of suspected poisoning!!!  Please only buy treats made in the USA!","523":"DON'T YOU KNOW THAT SUGAR IS THE SAND OF TIME ?  SINCE THE INGREDIENTS OF KAVLI CRISPY THIN WERE LISTED ON AMAZON, AND THE TIME I RECEIVED MY ORDER,  SUGAR  WAS ADDED TO THIS PRODUCT.  YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE, MISTER.","524":"This tea has NO flavor, tastes like dust It \"looks\" like quality -- pretty package -- but it's no good. Lipton regular Pekoe is farrr superior.","525":"Kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in Japan and is illegal to import in to the United states. In fact, it has been illegal to import since 2010 in any form. This is just overpriced regular American beef.","526":"Good but not my favorite.........Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag....I now buy my dogs Taste of the Wild Salmon just great stuff buy it on Amazon!~ The less fillers the better not meals for my doggies!~","527":"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1\/2 lb, 11\/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater.","528":"Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand.","529":"If you are looking for an actual organic dog food, Newman's Own is not the way to go. I accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package, only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic. With all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised \"food animals\" this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic.","530":"I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs. Notice all of them are at the beginning, which means they make up quite a bit of the diet. Soy protein is included but some dogs don't do well with soy (mine) and meat should be the protein source in dog food, not grains. Not recommended for your furry ones.","531":"I purchased two bags of this dogfood, after one week of feeding the newman brand, my dog started vomiting after eating, she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache, after having her checked for a stomach disorder, I took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared. I have sent three emails to newman dogfood website, no replies or acknowledgement, phone number not available, the dogfood is expensive and THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT.","532":"I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend.","533":"This food is organic, sure.  However, look at the ingredients, top 7 includes chicken meal.  Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product.  It's a cheap substitute, and really is bad for the dog.  I suggest a brand like Evo, Blue Buffalo, ect.  No ingredient should be meal or by product.","534":"Chicken Meal NOT legally allowed in human food  Subject to only the less-stringent animal food safety standards May contain \"4-D\" chicken products: * Diseased chickens * Chickens that were Dying prior to butchering * Chickens that were Dead prior to butchering * Disabled chickens (may carry more infections) Rendered May contain waste products * Restaurant waste * Meat processing facility waste * Packinghouse waste Not subject to testing for quality standards or nutrient levels, may vary widely from batch to batch","535":"The number one ingredient is chicken... not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldn't eat yourself. I will stick to Natural Balance which is sold here on Amazon as well.","536":"I will never again even CONSIDER a dog food with corn, wheat or soy in it. Grain has no place in a dog's diet!","537":"Both of my dogs had trouble with this formula, allergy wise.  It took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food.  Needless to say I won't buy this product again.","538":"The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.","539":"I bought a big pack of this gum.  The flavor (Kiwi Watermelon) is ok, but it didn't last long, I found I would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about 2-3 minutes to get another shot of flavor.  I Wouldn't really recommend this gum, it's not horrible, but not that great either.","540":"this gum is the worst i have ever purchased, plain and simple. within two seconds of chewing taste gone!","541":"I've never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.  That's strange, because I've been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction.  I \"tasted\" another piece from another pack (we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in Iraq), and again, my throat started burning.  So, if you have a history of food allergies, you might not want to try this flavor.","542":"Are you kidding me! $32.00!!! I buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under $10.00. No more then $15.00 at reqular stores. Watch these prices guys.","543":"I absolutely love this stuff, but I pay $2.00 to $2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store.  Why is this price so HIGH?","544":"You can get these SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much cheaper at wholesale clubs.  I get the 24\/20oz(yes 20oz!) for $11 or $12!! Its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store!","545":"I HATED this coffee.  I'm much more of a Starbucks or Peet's loyalist, so maybe I'm a bit spoiled.  But after reading many positive reviews of this company I decided to give it a try.  Big mistake.  I had a hard time giving it away.  It definitely tastes like chicory.  Blagk.  Bad news.","546":"When I got this it was melted through the package and what wasn't completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers.  You would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold.  I wasn't very happy with it.  I love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good.","547":"Very weak blend, slightly bitter aftertaste.  Noticeably light brew when brewing.  Won't purchase again, in fact, I regret this purchase.  Even on 4 oz brew, still really weak taste.","548":"After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)","549":"This tea didn't do anything, steal have issues with itching throat, ear and everything else. But I do enjoy the smell of it.. ill say it last up to a few hours and that's it.","550":"I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and I've tried it a few times. I don't enjoy the taste, and since I don't sweeten my tea, it wasn't that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller.","551":"I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but that's not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, we'd eat dirt.","552":"I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE!","553":"All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone. I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture. This company has superb customer service!","554":"I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work.","555":"I've tried a few of the different energy shots, and found that the \"5 hour energy\" have a flowery note (lavender?) in all of their flavours.  I can't say I like it. The _effect_ is ok, but the flavour is like bad\/flat orange pop, and is otherwise uninspiring. I think I'd prefer the more standard 'berry' flavour of other shots vs this one.","556":"I received these in bad condition. Most of them were broken, but the ones that weren't had holes in them. They were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. I would try three ladies brand. They are a way higher quality.","557":"I bought this brand and it was just horrible. Amazon needs to source and offer 3 Ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today.","558":"Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That's $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don't get it.","559":"I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go.","560":"I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That's deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them.","561":"These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative.","562":"Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.","563":"When I received this product it was old and dried out!  Dingo makes a good product.  I buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship.","564":"most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again","565":"I did not even receive the correct product, what I received were raw UNSHELLEd peanuts, but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this. I attempted to contact but got no reply, do not buy from here!","566":"I would agree with the other poor ratings for Royal Oak - very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are 'in season.' Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged.","567":"Go to Costco, and you can buy lower than this  price per oz. Currently $32 ($3 off regular $34.99)+ tax for big size = 0.83$\/oz.  Besides, it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formula  Be careful, many times some sellers over price a product, and still make the product rank in the best sellers.","568":"Be careful when odering this, because they say it's a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.  So if you did like I did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck!  So I know I will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren, because they won't be able to eat it.","569":"These were rancid upon receipt.  Terrible.  Very little sugar if any used.  Something went wrong with these as I can't believe anyone would see this as a final product.  Both cans!","570":"I felt ripped off. The photo clearly shows two bones and the price, at $8 plus, is indicative of two. I thought I was purchasing a \"bone\" packaged as two to a pack. Walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for $3.50 ea. Why doesn't the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one? It wasn't worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so I am doing it here.  Beartoothjoe","571":"It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring.","572":"Tastes too sweet, which Jerk Seasoning is not.  Walker's woods is the most authentic to taste.  This was a waste.","573":"I thought I would try this, but I am sticking with my UNCLE JOES JERK SAUCE!!! This is sweet & not hot....should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label","574":"(First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay any attention to those NO votes, they both arrived within minutes of posting this review.)  This sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is NOT jerk sauce, doesnt even remotely resemble a bad facsimile. I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuff is horrible.  BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets.","575":"These are very tasty, but way too sweet & sugary.  I felt like I was eating candy instead of meat.  If that's okay with you, then you'll probably love these, but I was looking for something a bit healthier.  Yes, I know it says 'sweet' in the product name, but I bought it because of the no hormone, no antibiotic, no artificial ingredient aspect.","576":"I wanted to love this because I LOVE Earl Grey tea, I NEED decaf and I ADORE the convenience of the Keurig.  Unfortunately, I don't love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesn't deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice.","577":"My kids love these, and we've ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)  too bad - but at this price, won't run the risk of having to toss out product.","578":"The consistency of the grain free chicken, turkey, lamb and fish formula was like baby poop.  There was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through a full case in a short time.  I can put the water in the cat food.  It is misleading and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product, call it a 13 oz can and provide nothing like I have come to know and expect from other brands the same size.","579":"I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing.","580":"Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.  It tastes like.....well, I can't use the words I'd like to. Let's just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I don't know if you'd even know it was coffee!  I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help.","581":"Warning: it contains food preservatives. Other than that it is fine, but presence of preservatives in dates (!) justifies my low 2 star rating.","582":"The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor.","583":"The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I don't believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so it's not that I don't know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow.","584":"Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas.","585":"Spent $29  for real kona coffee and didn't want the kona blend sold here. The Hawaiian roasters was disappointing. Tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in Maui. Not good","586":"I like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness. These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy. If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, don't order these.  Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global. They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa. Very adult and superb.","587":"We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !!","588":"BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER","589":"I can not believe that this is actually for sale. It needs to be recalled. Sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets. They do not digest\/assimilate sugar like we do. Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list, DO NOT BUY IT!!","590":"On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix.","591":"I ordered this from Amazon and they were pure liquid. Like water. I did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter. Amazon customer service, however, was awesome and gave me a full refund","592":"Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn't just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed.","593":"Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.  Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we'll need to go to the grocery store for.","594":"I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic.","595":"My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either. We'll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she's ready for table foods.","596":"We ordered the Earth's best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.  Found out we can't return the item, either.  We will try the Amazon phone help, but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff...","597":"Received 6 bottles of concentrate from Paragon. Mixed EXACTLY to their specs., and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors.  I am truly saddened to have to encourage you to NOT purchase the Watermelon flavor.  This item has be returned for a refund.","598":"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it.","599":"I ordered this because I really like this brand and I have never had any issue with them.  My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour\/spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore.","600":"Several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars. Jars are cheaper at Walmart.","601":"Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that it's $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping. (I've found this to be true for several other items on this site.) I'm not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think it's Amazon's responisbility to get to the bottom of this.","602":"I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth's best.","603":"Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.  Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we'll need to go to the grocery store for.","604":"There is BPA in the lids and company claims it doesn't touch the food so it's okey. Why do they even write ORGANIC 6 times around the lid? Not honest to their costumer. I wouldn't even give 1 star if l could.","605":"I have a 6.5 month old who eats #2 food all of the time. I bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste. Coincidentally, as I was thinking that as I was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air.  He couldn't breathe and I had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying.  VERY SCARY and those jars went right in the garbage.","606":"This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here, this is no deal.","607":"I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t","608":"I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this seller's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people?","609":"Maybe it's just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I can't taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing.","610":"I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.","611":"They have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad.. bad after taste. I guess it's so they don't stick together. Never again","612":"So as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package I opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all I got was a big goo of gummy bears. Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid-multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm, stop and wait till december.","613":"The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.","614":"I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.","615":"This is not for me. It was like eating a bowl of fat. Not my preference. Everyone is different. Personally i dont like this at all.","616":"this egg pasta ingredient was \"powdered egg product\" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing.  i don't like anything powdered, but price was RIGHT.  can't have it all i guess.","617":"I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Cora's olives are much, much better.","618":"I've read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  That's $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I don't understand the high price?","619":"I have never tasted this coffee.  But when people brew it in my house, it makes my house smell like farts.  It might taste really good, but I can't get over the fart smell.  You've been warned.","620":"The picture and description was Pure Butter Mini Shortbread Round, then I decided to order it because I love them so bad. But when i got the package, it came out at Mini CHOCOLATE CHIP shortbread which I don't like.","621":"When Habanero is in powder form it doesn't taste the same nor does it have the same heat. It's almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat.","622":"I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.  Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn't taste like anything.  Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly!","623":"WASA Crisp'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled.  The crackerbread is excellent, but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states I have contacted.  Todate WASA has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of, nor where I can recycle it.","624":"I bought two kinds of Davidson's bulk teas, Darjeeling and Gunpowder Green, and I was very disappointed in the quality. They both make kind of a murky harsh tea. The Darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe. The Gunpowder Green is weak and flat. I certainly wouldn't recommend them.","625":"The price is right. Organic Tea at a great price, but that's as far as it goes. I've tried about 5 of the Davidsons so far and they just lack character.","626":"I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought, oh well, maybe the soup will taste good. Wrong!Three different flavors but they were all awful, completely inedible. All of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting, the worst canned soups I have ever tasted in my life. Poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity. Complete waste of money.","627":"While the product is delicious, it's annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product. You need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet.","628":"My cats are not picky eaters, and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them (wellness, fussie cat, fancy feast, bff). I tried feeding them Tiki Cat on 2 separate occasions, and my cats threw up both times. I thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor, but when it happened a second time I was certain it was the Tiki Cat. I'm not sure if I received a bad batch, but I will certainly never be purchasing a Tiki Cat product again.","629":"She liked the food a little at first but didn't want much to do with it... The price is very high and not worth it if she'll only eat a couple of bites. She had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction.","630":"This product smells so bad that I couldn't even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so I'm out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage.","631":"I purchased these beans based on other reviews.  My plan was to make a Premium Vanilla Extract for family members.  I purchased a very expensive Vodka, unusual bottles to fill, and waited for my bean order to arrive.  I wasn't happy about the wait.  The beans arrived after the 4th, and I rushed to open the package.  I could not smell the beans as others reported!  Most of the beans were skinny\/shriveled, more dry, and a great disappointment.  I Would Not recommend this product.  I will be looking for another source.","632":"True, the beans were huge, moist and plump, with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones.  However, the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent, with a side of sour.  Is that normal?!?  I've only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version, and was THRILLED when I saw such a good deal on these.  Can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd, unpleasant aroma is what I'm supposed to be smelling??","633":"Would have rated no star if available.  Beefeaters\u00ae Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated \"for your protection\" according to the company's hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre-paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com!","634":"Anyone see where theses are made? - I am avoiding treats from China because of all the problems lately. and I do not see a country of origin here.","635":"One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.  See my review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES for info on several products I \"tested\" in search of a flavor\/appetite enhancer, including this shrimp version and another F&S tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four.","636":"I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor\/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent.","637":"This was not good. The flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the Hint water -- which I really enjoy. I wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed.","638":"Personal preference... too sweet.  Tastes like General Foods International Coffees.  Price is great if you like that, though.  And makes up very easy.","639":"I don't think it's EB, I think it's Amazon. I buy EB from Babies R Us, Target and Whole Foods, and haven't had any problems. It's only the shipments from Amazon that come moldy.","640":"My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn't contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn't even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why.","641":"This was NOT a hit!  It's bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and\/or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second \"gourmet meal\" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing.","642":"My girls seem to like this food - they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It's apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking.","643":"Earth's Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods, but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food.  Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff (it looks gritty).  He normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food...turning his head after a couple of bites.","644":"It was bad before we open them. I saw them when we got. I did open. It had some spot green color. I did not know what it was. I was very upset. Do not buy this product.","645":"This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didn't last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!!","646":"I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.  I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else.","647":"I am big coffee lover.  This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all.","648":"I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!","649":"Several of the seller's listings indicate 20% Kona blend.....but the delivered product does NOT have this package printing. As a long-time Kona coffee drinker, the contents are more indicative of 10% (or less) Kona coffee. Have ordered twice....and completely disappointed.","650":"You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.","651":"The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.","652":"I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!","653":"I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.","654":"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.","655":"Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa's I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!!","656":"I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.  GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.  This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.  It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.  If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!!","657":"Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.  Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.  That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!","658":"I bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic.  BEWARE!  The package shown in the photo is not an organic product.","659":"My recommendation? Get a juicer and make your own, or try Odwalla. The taste was bitter, and the smell was strange and foul. The label says \"Enriched with organic lemon juice\" and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. Maybe it was the lemon I tasted, I don't know. I had about three sips and couldn't stomach it.","660":"I tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it.  I took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar.  It was awful.  I've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.  It has lemon juice in it, but apparently far far too much.  If you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice, you will love this product.  I don't.","661":"I don't know how they did it - but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice I have ever had.  I think it has to do with the long shelf life - expires in 2012, I drank it in 2010 (well I tried to drink it).  It was probably bottled in 2007 or something.  YYEECCHH!!","662":"I bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is, 'unsulphered'. I called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered. Although it does have a higher percentage of iron, I'm going back to Plantation.","663":"The shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent.  All other items in this order were excellent.  These were lollipops shaped and \"painted\" like flamingos.  But you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are!  They'll be \"OK\" to set out on the candy buffet, but they won't be the eye-catching item we'd anticipated when we ordered.","664":"I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. I've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money.","665":"I ordered this glitter based on the fact it advertised it was edible.  I wouldn't even try to feed this to anyone let alone on a cake for children!  I read several reviews and they all said how fantastic it was so I purchased on good faith.  When it arrived I wanted to see if it had a taste...it tastes like I assume craft glitter would taste.  I packaged it to send it back but didn't. If you want a trust worthy edible glitter, stick with Wilton products.","666":"If I could give this food a zero I would. I tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. It was horrible, smelled bad, and I would never get it again!","667":"I bought the kit to dabble in spherification. The item is as-described and arrived on time. My complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams. My kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams. I cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams. Therefore I find the kit difficult to use. I would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams.","668":"These things are like eating poker chips with seasoning salt.  They're remarkably high in calories, too!","669":"This is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all.  It's very light, with unevenly sized beans -- clearly a blend.  Some beans are normal size and some are tiny.  The hazelnut aroma and flavor is good, but this coffee is not strong at all -- even using twice as many grounds, I could not get enough coffee flavor from these beans.  People who like very weak coffee will probably love this.  People who like Starbucks will not like this one bit.","670":"It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill's.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill's.  Not recommended!","671":"I blame myself for trying to save a buck - this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds - they say it's a dark blend but it's not even close to a dark roast I buy at stores.  In the end, I have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it's OK.","672":"If you like a rich dark coffee, this product is NOT for you!  We'd been looking for an organic alternative, and I've tried some great ones, so we ordered this when it was on special.  Unfortunately, we ordered 6 cans to get the discount, and now we are stuck with organic, but very dull tasting coffee.  To make the best of it, we've bought other tried and true rich dark brands to mix with it.  Very disappointing!","673":"so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again","674":"When the flowers showed up, they were in pretty bad shape.  I figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days.  Didn't happen.  They went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival.","675":"I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders.","676":"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half.","677":"I'm really disappointed with the changes in quality -- it's not even the same product that we used to love.  A couple of years ago, the product was consistently fantastic, but now the taste, quality of the meat, and freshness are hit or miss...and recently it's all been a miss.","678":"I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they're just way too salty and definitely not worth $20","679":"The Jack Link's 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1\/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!!","680":"too salty -- enough said. I order the wood smoked 30-count jar. Remember, the price is for only ONE JAR (not two).","681":"I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted?","682":"I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. I've even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite.","683":"this is a good name and a good value; the texture and size of the jerky is fine, but be prepared for the salt. It ruined it for me.","684":"Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.","685":"First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought!","686":"I buy Jack Links Peppered Jerky every month.  I tried these as this was the first time seeing them.  Don't waste your money.  They are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them!!  They do not taste anything like the other \"Peppered\" jerkys.  Stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle.","687":"This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Don't buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog won't eat it :-)","688":"I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review.","689":"I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one.","690":"This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Don't make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere.","691":"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.","692":"Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by \"Godiva 4 Pack\", they mean \"4 pieces of candy\"!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!!","693":"My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...","694":"Aweful! They arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement! The bags' supposed re-sealable zipper,didn't re-seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again, I cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was!","695":"Skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here, I have seen this same bag for $5.89 on sale and not on sale for $7.99 at some big chain stores. the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just don't overspend to get a big bag (price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags)","696":"... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is INSANE!  The sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping, it was not worth it.","697":"The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just can't handle the texture.  It's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it.  I've been gluten free for about 6 years, and there are much better products out there.  My kids won't even eat these!","698":"Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat\/gluten. Therefore I generally 'love' any cookies I'm not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah.","699":"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are \"No Gluten\" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.","700":"I purchased these because they do not contain dairy, soy or corn.  Well, in addition to being dairy free, soy free.... they are FLAVOR FREE!  Absolutely horrible dry tasting bars.  First words out of my mouth were \"tastes like dirt\" so that's what I'm going with.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.","701":"These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b\/c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack-loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money.","702":"I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.","703":"i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . .","704":"tastes like dry brownie w\/ invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars.","705":"It's Crunchy, I'm now love the smoother Nana's Like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000FNEX8C\">Nana's No Gluten Lemon Cookie, 3.5-Ounce Cookies (Pack of 12)<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000FNEX8M\">Nana's No Gluten Chocolate Cookie, 3.5-Ounces (Pack of 12)<\/a> you get the idea I hope!! I don't have coffee or Chocolate anymore! If you don't have a problem GREAT but I found out I do!!","706":"THis product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies!  Try Pamela's!","707":"be careful...even though this is listed under gluten free section it is NOT gluten free","708":"I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.","709":"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee.","710":"This device's lid does not seal.  I am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan.  Did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation.","711":"The item shipped in an unsealed plastic bag within a brown cardboard shipping sleeve. Arrived with product loose and falling out of the cardboard.  No effort had been made to seal the plastic bag or the shipping sleeve. Unbelievable. The product itself is very foul tasting with a horrible lingering aftertaste. Could be the coating?  I am very disappointed in the purchase and would never buy again. Especially from this vendor. Stay away from these!","712":"Ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual. He is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food. Now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad, like the poster above, its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in","713":"Disappointed.  The big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes.  I am not sure why but not good.","714":"We recently purchased the K-Cup machine and I was quite excited as I drink iced tea rather than coffee. This blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what I was looking for. It works as advertised, just not the right tea for me.","715":"Not a big fan.  Will not buy this again.  plus she eats it really quick too, other than the throw up part.","716":"the product was hard as a rock. i could not even break it in half. both dogs had hard time chewing them. puppy could not either will not get product again. unless the two packages i got were old and dried out.","717":"We have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these!  Unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest.","718":"These taste great!  And it's true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth.  However, as an energy boost for running, they don't do a thing for me.  In fact, they actually cause a stitch.  So I just eat them whenever I feel I need a sugary 'fix'.","719":"I didn't like this carbonated juice.  Although it appears to be all juice (not artificial flavors) it tastes somewhat artificial.  Perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice (which tastes NOTHING like REAL orange juice)!  I fully expected to like this as I do like fizzy fruit juice drinks.  This one did not do it for me.","720":"It is a good thing the can is so small. The product is several cuts below Sunny Delight. Terrible!","721":"Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can","722":"This product taste like an orange juice, an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor I didn't like it.","723":"The product may be every bit as healthy as they claim, but even if that's true, I could barley get down one can of this stuff.  It tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it.  It doesn't taste anything like orange soda, and the taste it does have isn't very pleasant.  Also leaves a very nasty aftertaste, and like many sodas, this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking.  All in all, I cannot recommend this.  Stay away.","724":"I expected to like this drink because I like various fruit juices and I like carbonated beverages, as well.  Unfortunately, I just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink. It was thick, had very little bubbly carbonation and, for me anyway, there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time.  I finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth.","725":"I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst!","726":"This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. It's not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.","727":"My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking.","728":"The product says a twist because of carbonation. Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.  As far as the taste goes I did not care for the taste at all. It left a bad after taste in my mouth I cannot recommend this product. I will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost.  To be fair I gave it two stars because my wife thought it was OK.","729":"This tastes like carbonated orange juice, very tart.  It is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages.  If one had allergies or health issues, it might be worth drinking.","730":"Described as an alternative to soda, Switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100% natural juices (although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor).  Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.  Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda.","731":"I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.  Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:  1. Watermelon Strawberry 2. Kiwi Berry 3. Black Cherry 4. Orange Tangerine","732":"The can says it's 100% juice, but the taste is ...powdery.  If you've ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light, you'll know what I mean.  So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.  I did not like it.","733":"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again.","734":"If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix.","735":"These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece.  If they were at my local grocery, I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them.  I didn't really like the flavor that well, but if you did, they might even worth up to fifty cents per can.  Otherwise, pass these up.","736":"This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water - less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I don't think I will purchase again.","737":"I've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one.","738":"This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.  What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.","739":"I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy, ultra sweet drink, not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty.","740":"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as \"all-natural\" but had ingredients like \"natural flavors and colors\". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink.","741":"Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.  Bottom line: If you're die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice.","742":"I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.  Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.  It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.  Try the Kiwi Berry instead.","743":"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus.","744":"I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier. Maybe it would be an acquired taste but I won't  be drinking it again to find out.  Oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good.","745":"I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more \"natural\" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special.","746":"The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice.","747":"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a \"healthy\" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass.","748":"well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a \"natural\" product it sure didn't taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.  I personally wouldn't buy this product. 2 stars","749":"Ouch, this stuff is sweet, as in REALLY sweet...  This is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed.  Most soda doesn't have this much sugar, the 8.3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar, yikes!  For a 12 oz can of soda, that would be like having 45 grams of sugar, who would drink that?  They need to water this WAY down, we're going to end up giving the rest of this away, we can't drink it.","750":"The only way we could make Switch Orange-Tangerine drinkable was mixing 50\/50 with club soda. It was just way too sweet. It then tasted good, but Orangina and San Pelligrino both have awesome Orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix! And surprisingly, imported San Pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger (11.3 oz. as opposed to 8 oz).","751":"This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be \"100% juice,\" but this drink has some kick.  There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.  It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you.","752":"I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer.","753":"The first shipment I received of this item was great. Lids fit easily. This last shipment, either the lids are slightly larger or the cups are smaller. The lids are extremely hard to get on. If I press too hard the cup starts to buckle. I've actually started to use a pair of pliers to get the lids on!","754":"Caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time I used it.  Great idea, just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it.","755":"THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.","756":"The product stinks and that's mildly stated.  The caps do not snap on easily and if you apply too much pressure the cup part caves in and you end up with ground coffee everywhere.  I threw the whole order into the trash and called it a day.  I will be using professionally produced K-cups (i.e, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, even Folgers) from this point on.","757":"For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w\/ thumb.  Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.  Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem. (Jiggle it and it will generally loosen up.)","758":"The Solo K-cup works perfectly instead of these.  I Totally agree with the Poor Performance review.  I also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime I used these (yes even with the filter). The cup is poorly designed. It clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit.","759":"The products lid stays attached to the needle on the Keurig, allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere. Very messy. If this didn't happen, it would work well.","760":"These cups were difficult to cap (putting the lids on securely was a comedy show) and they created a mess when used in the Keurig; the water went everywhere.  Add together PIA and MESS with an end outcome of weak cup o' Joe = I'm not a very happy buyer.","761":"The lids are impossible to secure.  This purchase was a complete waste of money.  Product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured.","762":"I ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. They don't fit together without a big production. The lids won't fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. Just a big mess. not what I wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. Donna Phillips","763":"I am sorry to say I had trouble with the cups themselves. Each time I used them, my machine would say \"decalcify\" which I did the first time. When I used them the 2nd and 3rd times, the problem occurred again. I was able to clear the hot water spout with a toothpick, which remedied the problem. I will not use them again, though, because I don't want to have to do that after every use.","764":"The units go together easily, but no matter how much or little coffee I put in the filter, it caused overflow. It's as if the filters are too thick. I also had a few cups that didn't pierce correctly.  Definitely not worth the money for these!","765":"These little cups are a waste of money. The Kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup, and as a result I ended up with several half cups of coffee.  I tried it about 10 times, and then gave up.","766":"I got coffee grounds in my cup 4 out of the 5 times I used these. Very disappointed because I would like to use my coffee. The hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one punched out with the regular K-cups, probably due to the design on the bottom of the cup. I have to flush the system each time I have used this product, wasting time and water.","767":"Bought a pack of a 100 of these and each cup it takes so long to process the coffee.. Each cup I get coffee grounds in and not a whole cup of coffee.. Great concept, I believe the paper filter is to fine which holds back the coffee and pressure which results in bleeding of coffee grounds out of the 2 other holes.. Regular K Cups work work much better.. Again great idea, just not so great of a product..","768":"The service and delivery from Amazon was great.  However, the product itself is not worth buying.  No matter what I try, coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing....it makes a mess!  Wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee (Tim Hortons), but guess I'll just have to get used to other brands!","769":"The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. It's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K-cups for me!","770":"We put together the cups.  Everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter. When putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip.  I checked everything and it was put together correctly. I took the made up cups to my son's coffee maker keurig brand also, it did the same thing.  It starts out ok only made drips of coffee. We tried it with two different modes of Keurig and both did not work.It did make holes in right places.","771":"These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.","772":"Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.  Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste.","773":"I thought I was purchasing a high quality item but it's not all that. The chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture. I'm going to say it's not worth the money and I'm not satisfied. At the same time of purchasing this product I also bought Sunmaid chocolate covered raisons which I rate from a 1-10...a 10. Now we are talking about yumminess!!!!! So customers...if you are going to choose...let it be the Sunmaid...you won't be dissappointed","774":"Well, at least they live up to their name. These nuts are definitely hot, too bad that's all the positive I have to say about them. Other than that, they taste like cardboard, and not very good cardboard either.","775":"MADE IN CHINA.. Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor. Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only.....","776":"I eat mixed nuts all the time at work. They make a healthy snack instead of the donuts, etc. that are always around. The plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. The down side is that they are almost all cashews. Very few brazil nuts, pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. The lack of variety is disappointing.","777":"The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt.","778":"I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there.","779":"These are a cheap fake. Nothing like the real Emerald nuts you buy in the store. Its a complete waste of money. DONT get ripped off like I did.","780":"Good quality product, but you would have to REAlly love curry flavor to like these... They are so awful I don't know what to do with them, but I know I won't be eating them.... I'll stick to the plain sea salt ones:)","781":"Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again.","782":"Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn.","783":"All of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great. Truth is, I am disappointed. The popcorn kernels are tough, chewy and lack any great corn taste. I want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it.  I will go back to buying the premium Orville Redenbacher's brand at my local grocery.","784":"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again.","785":"I do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating, but I can't bring myself to enjoy them. I bought the 6-pack variety and have tried the Maple Cinnamon and the Onion Garlic. I generally like flax, but these just aren't setting well with me even when I use them as a carrier for dips. I feel I wasted my money. I'll probably give the unopened packs to a friend's family that are gluten free.","786":"I bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast. The order said it'd take 5 business days. It ended up taking over 3 weeks","787":"I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.","788":"I'm sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!!","789":"The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars).","790":"Very disappointed, not much pumpkin or spice, just pretty close to plain old coffee.  I was hoping for something like they have at Tim Horton's but its not even close.","791":"The ones I received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green, dry and somewhat stale, they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have!","792":"This is simply a mix of brown sugar and Splenda, I am sure it would be cheaper to make your own","793":"These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum).  I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they aren't fresh), and it is.  These are Tuber indicums.  It says so right on the label.  I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled \"black winter truffles\".","794":"I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better. There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry","795":"Had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture. Better off buying the high price truffles.","796":"We tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities. We sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved. The price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles.  Spend your money on white truffle oil you'll be much happier, we are.  Also wait for the white truffles to come in from Italy, I would not knock JR as a company but would not recommend this offering.","797":"There was absolutly no scent or flavor to this.When I brought home truffles from Aosta in Italy they were wonderful and cost less. These were worthless.","798":"i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again","799":"I should have listened to the negative reviews, but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true. There was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto I made. I agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless. Not worth even this price for truffles.","800":"I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle. These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please don't waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldn't even believe these could be called truffles.","801":"Zero stars for this item.  I couldn't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle.  This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.  As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored.","802":"I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. They'd have to be. There'd be no comparison. These are really bad.","803":"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one.","804":"This is the worst flavored coffee I have ever tried.  There is no aroma or flavor of Chocolate\/Raspberry to this coffee bean at all.  In fact the coffee tastes sour.  I too am sorry I couldn't buy just 1 lb. to try it first -- Now I am stuck with this awful coffee I cannot return.  SO, BUYER BEWARE -- NO RETURNS!","805":"I like some of Coffee Bean Direct coffees, but I cannot stand the taste of this one, and no one else in the house likes it either. I wish I could of bought it in a smaller package, rather than the 5 lb bag that cost over $30. I do not recommend this product to anyone, but everybody has their own taste, and some people may like it.","806":"This is an awful coffee. The flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee.","807":"Love the taste of this product, really keeps you full with just a small amount.  First bought it at Costco, they no longer sell this product.  The reason for the two stars, half the bag was crushed, could eat it with a spoon.","808":"Check out the nutritional info, the SODIUM: 5,510 grams! 230% of your daily requirement. I used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty!!!!!! And what's up with that price? My box cost a dollar. Unfortunately I bought two boxes, so I'm throwing the other box away. No bargain here. It is wildly UN-delicious and UN-healthy for you! (Yeah, I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the label first!)","809":"Second time I have reported this. One jar broken and order Not what pictured. Jam same but jar different. I know my ginger  This not same.","810":"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.  Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don't know better.","811":"tastes - burnt, roasted, slightly rotten sunflower seed taste; gritty, bland - no salt,sugar only seeds. would not eat if it was free.\"","812":"I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  I'm pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted \"off\" almost.  I'm really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  I'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhena's.... maybe I'll like another flavor.  I haven't given up on you yet.","813":"This soup is advertised as \"creamy,\" however when it arrived it was \"signature.\"  Puck changed the recipe of the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup and is now calling it Signature Butternut Squash Soup.  It does not taste the same (and is not as good) as the original recipe.","814":"The soup is rich and tasty, but DON'T buy it from Amazon.  The packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment. I got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer.","815":"This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.","816":"I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The \"cheese\" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware.","817":"I love Annie's, but this had no taste, very bland and unappealing. I would not purchase this again, but worst of all I'm stuck with 6 boxes...boo!","818":"The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1\/2 loaf.  I checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results.  After raising the temp to 100 degrees I got it to rise to 3\/4 loaf.  Pretty expensive for the quality and I won't buy again.","819":"I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant's condition.  It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed. This was, for me, a complete waste of my time and money.  I paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didn't do a bit of good.  Very disappointing.","820":"this plant appears to be dead on arrival.... ive had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well 20.00 for a dead weed... no thanks they wouldnt let me submit this review with out clicking a star... not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine...i have three","821":"Ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion. The amazon shipping was acceptable, but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment, unless they were to put \"This side up\" on the box. The dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant (Audrey) was upside down, roots up in the box. If I had found one locally I would have bought it there. Hoping Audrey survives, but I don't have high hopes. EDIT: Audrey is now deceased. Do not recommend.","822":"Plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container, probably better to buy one locally. I dont think its gonna make it....","823":"The plant was upside down in the box and I had to put the roots back inside the planter.  It never came out of shock and turned black and died.","824":"Hi  - ordered the Venus fly trap...very quick service, nice vendor, but the plant died and turned black...over the next 3 days after we got it...","825":"i had a second plant to replace the first one. it to came in sad shape, i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant. dont waste your time with this vender.","826":"The plant arrived dead.  It cost as much to ship.  I did not want to hassle with any kind of return.  I should know better than to buy a plant on line.","827":"I received an undersized, sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health. What was I thinking ordering a plant over the Internet? Never again!","828":"It only lasted 2 days. Came mostly dead. Glad it was only 10 bucks. It was also very small so. The flies I wanted it to eat , it couldn't.","829":"I received the pant faster than expected, but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised. I have very little hope that this plant will live out this week, but if it does I will update this review with a higher rating.","830":"I ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it.  She said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died.  I wish I had known sooner but she just told me last week.","831":"Two of the three plants were dying and are now dead. They all were tiny!!! They are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldn't even fit in the bloom.  Rip Off!!! Do not do business with this vendor...","832":"i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol","833":"I was given a track number and told it was delivered to my POBOX.  It never happened.  I received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder.","834":"The last shipment I received, when preparing the milk there were black specks or particles in it. It was in two out of the three containers. I don't even know if it was in the first can i used. This was the first time it's happened and I've been using goats milk for my daughter since December 2011 and she loves it. Plus it didn't constipated her like whole cow's milk. Now I'm leary about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again.","835":"Too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods.  I'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet.  I do love the taste of goats milk.  It's very rich and creamy.  The liquid is better than the powder.","836":"Arrived in good condition, looks like well-made cans. Tastes nice, and I would love to use this product, but unfortunately, i got an allergic reaction from it.","837":"$136 for 12 boxes?  Is this a rare item?  That's $11.33 a box.  I think the item might be a bit overpriced.","838":"I tried many teas and thought would try this kind. Saw it on Dr. OZ show. Didn't like its taste.","839":"I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don't like. The smell isn't that great either","840":"i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag ...not gallon size =( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum \"double bubble\" i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting...","841":"Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me.","842":"I didn't order because it doesn't indicate anywhere what size the bottle is, I think that's basic information, maybe you should include that in your description","843":"Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased.","844":"This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed.","845":"I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12).","846":"This soup is just offensive.  Why does it taste like cinnamon?  Also, it's twice the price of Campbell's and 1\/4 the chicken.  Sure, it says it's organic.  I totally believe that, don't you?","847":"I found this exact same product, same size at our local grocery store (QFC and Safeway) for $2.99. So, am not sure why this product is priced so much higher.","848":"$5.00 over the local grocer's regular price. I expected a fair market price when I placed this order, but because I didn't research it I was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated. Live and learn, I hope I can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return.","849":"Purchased two liters... looking for an oil to put in salads, on bread, etc... something with a strong flavor of olive oil... this is NOT it.  This is good for cooking... has little flavor.","850":"I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL. I ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color wasn't right. It was still obviously brown. Perhaps my expectations were too high.","851":"The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper.","852":"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!","853":"The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable.","854":"Pan Ducale Almond Biscotti were a  disappointment to me, not because they were bad, but because they could not come close to the great Lettieri Prato Belli Cantuccini Almond Cookies.  At best they are low in calories - also in almonds.","855":"I thought I'd be writing a review raving about this product.  Sadly, I'm not. I would never use it for home use.  It tasted \"muddy\" and bitter. I followed the directions. I even made sure the water was hot but not boiling. I'd probably take it backbacking, but that's it. It's worth a try if you haven't tasted it yet. Read some of the other neutral reviews.  It might help with expectations.","856":"This sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing...so I ordered some.  We had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter.  To us, it is dreadful.  It has the texture of paste and not even palatable...for us.  Am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save.  When you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal, I'm sorry I was fooled by these flavors.","857":"Caribbean Joy coconut milk offers a tempting price, lower than its competitors.  There's a good reason for its low price: by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk, the rest being water. Neither good for pina coladas or cooking, this is a poor value and I can't recommend it to anyone.","858":"I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion. This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.","859":"My 9 1\/2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it.  There isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff.  It looks like a weird mushy green stuff.  I am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all.","860":"The grains make this food really flakey. It just doesn't stick together and was falling off the spoon. A major mess really. It also doesn't have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty.","861":"Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product.","862":"My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isn't very easy to clean up. I definitely won't buy these again, it's too expensive to only last 5 minutes.","863":"Overpriced beans, they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight.  The beans were thin and almost dry.  Get the cheaper options at amazon instead, they are much better and way cheaper...","864":"I would we willing to try this product, and have six envelopes in my cupboard, but unfortunately the instructions are in German.  Maybe I can hire an interpreter??","865":"All baking soda is aluminum free. This is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product. Buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free; but do not be duped into thinking that good ole $.59 Arm&Hammer has aluminum in it. BTW the chemical process used to make A&H is almost exactly what occurs in nature; just faster but not cheaper. It costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture. So yes you are paying for a name.","866":"I just called Bob's Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under \"contact us\" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOB'S RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. I've been paying $10-15 (with shipping) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the Bob's Red Mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you don't believe me. Ugh.","867":"I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.","868":"Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn't seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, it's just about all I can taste.  I guess I'll just give up on Tazo - who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine!","869":"This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.  The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract","870":"Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea.","871":"I purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile. The product has no sweet smell as one would expect. I have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier, no response.","872":"I got sent the wrong item, which happens i know.  I tried to contact the company multiple times with no response.  I finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me...","873":"Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk.","874":"My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?","875":"I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.","876":"I've tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes. They LOVE it, they WANT it, it's CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, I'd consider this a bad purchase.","877":"Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn't before. I've tried all of them, and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. This doesn't happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce.","878":"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.  Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up.  I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats.  Expensive but have never made my cats sick.  Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews?","879":"My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.","880":"My sister gave her cats these and loved them, so I got them for my cats. Our 4 cats have been vomiting a lot lately, and we traced it back to these treats. Google whiskas temptations recall...they were recalled not too long ago and I don't know why they are still on shelves. Don't buy these... They will make your cat sick and who know what else it's doing to their internal system. Please keep your cats away from this product!","881":"i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then \"drink up\"..blech.","882":"Does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy? I'm still hunting for a cracker I don't have to make. Their website is unclear about it's source.","883":"Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad. Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine. Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct. I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon. Will not use it again.","884":"I felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties... Too bad none of the would eat it, no matter what I did.  Donated it to the local SPCA -- maybe a dog will eat it.","885":"I used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars??? how did it double out of nowhere??","886":"This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.","887":"I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though.","888":"This is a good decaf coffee, but I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.","889":"Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.  I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.","890":"No where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee.  By the name I thought it was a Jamaican Blue Mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut.  Not very good","891":"I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.","892":"I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out it's simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.  We have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips.  Now I have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn't go to waste.","893":"I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!","894":"I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve","895":"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again.","896":"Coffee tastes great, but the cups get torn apart when brewing.  What a mess that is!!  I am quite disappointed because I do like this flavor of coffee!!","897":"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others.","898":"It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK!","899":"I ordered 3 boxes of 18 each.............and opened one box to find they were PODS and not for Keurig, AND I can't return them!!!?????  Yes,the pods fit into the Keurig but the end product is weak and awful.  I am most disappointed","900":"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again.","901":"Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though.","902":"Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen\/melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.  The affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the Keurig.","903":"love the wolfgang puck restaurants,cookware,brand endorsed products, all his brand products \/ cuisine are amazing, i am a loyal fan, yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless, no real coffee flavor, no hint of caramel or creme, it brews like a bit of steamed milk, that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate. soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand, products. sadly,a waste of funds, did not return because i think food items are none refundable.","904":"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work.","905":"This flavor is horrible.  There are many other flavors much better.  Hawaiian Hazelnut is great!  Breakfast in Bed is AWesome!","906":"If you like to taste the \"flavor\" in your flavored coffee, skip this one. I've struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here. The coffee flavor is also slightly bitter, but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring! I'd recommend Green Mountain, Gloria Jeans or Van Houtte brands before this one.","907":"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices.","908":"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed.","909":"I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.","910":"I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little \"nutty\" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends, also Emeril's Big Easy bold.","911":"Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.","912":"...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla\/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I can't drink it. Would not purchase again and I'm having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck.","913":"I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel","914":"I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again!","915":"This coffee says Dark Roast & Extra Bold and.... IT ISN'T! It's weak and barely beats out a cup of Folgers.","916":"I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.","917":"10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.  This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.","918":"I REALLY like the taste of this coffee! My only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. Not a huge fan of that and even though I really like the taste of it I will not order again, bummer!! =(","919":"I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.  I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label. It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.  I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.","920":"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a \"Creme Caramel\" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee.","921":"This is a good French roast coffee, although it could be a little bolder. I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.","922":"I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didn't measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didn't care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why.","923":"This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all. I found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did I have to go down a brew size, but I also have to add less milk just too drink it. I will never buy it again. Wish I didn't have 45 more cups to go thru!","924":"I ordered Wolf Gang Puck's k cups, largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants, both of which are good. However, when I drank my first cup of the Breakfast Blend, I tasted no coffee...it was as if I was drinking hot water. I was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which I know to be good. Sorry Wolf Gang, this is a sleeper!","925":"I am only drinking it, so it won't be wasted, and I have to rotate it with a Coffee People product, so I remember why I like coffee.  It is really wan. The strongest flavor profile is tin.  I love creme caramel and am a huge WP fan, but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. Choose another - you won't be sorry you did.","926":"My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one.","927":"I love Wolfgang Puck products but the coffee is very disappointing. There is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted! Some troll must have changed out all the real Puck products! Libbie","928":"This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder.","929":"I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.","930":"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it.","931":"I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.","932":"I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.","933":"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this.","934":"The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  I'm going to stick to Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now.","935":"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours.","936":"I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.  It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross.","937":"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more \"class.\"  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!","938":"The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.","939":"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee.","940":"I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.","941":"This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had! I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring. Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!","942":"Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...","943":"This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.","944":"This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.","945":"No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.","946":"The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!!","947":"I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.","948":"this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good","949":"Wolfgang Puck's \"Breakfast in Bed\" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one.","950":"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page.","951":"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As \"flavored\" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable.","952":"Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this!","953":"Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton.","954":"Very difficult to work with - tends to turn to solid rock even when following directions - taste is less than desirable","955":"and the expiration date on top of the can says Jan.06,05. I cannot even return it since it is a grocery. Amazon, are you serious?","956":"I'm on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly.  Think it is very good.  Try their salsa.  Couple of jars of this & a couple of jars of another pasta suace, spices, seasonings, etc.  However, the $44.00+ shipping cost is a major rip-off.  Try one of two or three sites on Google.  You will save $20.00 to $30.00 a case.","957":"This is a good product, especially for iced coffee, but why is it twice the price as it is in stores?  This isn't a fluke--within the past two months I've bought it for $5 a jar in Seattle and in Nevada, so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging.  Try harder Amazon.","958":"Medaglia D'Oro has to be the worst coffee I've ever had. It had an old musty flavor and odor. You get what pay for.","959":"I of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch.  I travel around Europe extensively and there are several brands available there which aren't at all bad.  This brand is OK for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards, etc., but as a beverage, it rates rock bottom in my book.","960":"I usually order Bustelo Decaffeinated coffee and I am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed. It's really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. I ordered the 4-pack and would really like to send back the three that I haven't opened yet if I can do that...","961":"I was hopeful, but left unsatisfied. The color of the bean grounds says it all; a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso, even decaf. Taste is weak and odd, not rich and solid. Certainly not worth the extra $$. Recommend Cafe Bustelo instead.","962":"t may be expresso grind, but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker: think again. Bitter when drunk on own. Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. I shoulda known betta!","963":"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice\/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more \"heat\" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.  With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.","964":"In general I like Walker's products. I tried to avoid ordering cookies this year and try the oatcakes. They aren't very good. The flavor is very mild wheat (maybe like a triscuit?), but the texture is off-putting. They are chewy and make me think of eating cardboard. I tried them with soup, with cheese, and with peanut butter. They were tolerable with peanut butter. Maybe someone else has discovered a better way to eat them?","965":"My first time having Curry Rice.  But boy, I cooked this stuff exactly how you're supposed to.  Taste...wasn't bad, I guess, a little \"Strong\" though.  IT was thick, like ice slush...it was over-bearing and the spice was pretty intense.  I don't think I'll get it again...I guess it's good stuff, seen it in some curry making videos...used often, but...not for me, as it it is way to thick.  I had potatoes, onions, and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it...and I could not taste them, at all. I could not taste the pork, or anything. Only the Sauce.","966":"We tried this formula because it is lactose free, my baby does not have any other issues, just lactose intolerant. We found that it smells bad, does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop.","967":"Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when it's dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product.","968":"We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor.","969":"Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed.","970":"My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often.","971":"This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.

It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again.","986":"Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though.","987":"Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen\/melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.  The affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the Keurig.","988":"love the wolfgang puck restaurants,cookware,brand endorsed products, all his brand products \/ cuisine are amazing, i am a loyal fan, yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless, no real coffee flavor, no hint of caramel or creme, it brews like a bit of steamed milk, that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate. soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand, products. sadly,a waste of funds, did not return because i think food items are none refundable.","989":"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work.","990":"This flavor is horrible.  There are many other flavors much better.  Hawaiian Hazelnut is great!  Breakfast in Bed is AWesome!","991":"If you like to taste the \"flavor\" in your flavored coffee, skip this one. I've struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here. The coffee flavor is also slightly bitter, but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring! I'd recommend Green Mountain, Gloria Jeans or Van Houtte brands before this one.","992":"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices.","993":"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed.","994":"I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.","995":"I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little \"nutty\" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends, also Emeril's Big Easy bold.","996":"Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.","997":"...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla\/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I can't drink it. Would not purchase again and I'm having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck.","998":"I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel","999":"I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again!","1000":"This coffee says Dark Roast & Extra Bold and.... IT ISN'T! It's weak and barely beats out a cup of Folgers.","1001":"I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.","1002":"10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.  This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.","1003":"I REALLY like the taste of this coffee! My only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. Not a huge fan of that and even though I really like the taste of it I will not order again, bummer!! =(","1004":"I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.  I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label. It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.  I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.","1005":"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a \"Creme Caramel\" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee.","1006":"This is a good French roast coffee, although it could be a little bolder. I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.","1007":"I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didn't measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didn't care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why.","1008":"This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all. I found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did I have to go down a brew size, but I also have to add less milk just too drink it. I will never buy it again. Wish I didn't have 45 more cups to go thru!","1009":"I ordered Wolf Gang Puck's k cups, largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants, both of which are good. However, when I drank my first cup of the Breakfast Blend, I tasted no coffee...it was as if I was drinking hot water. I was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which I know to be good. Sorry Wolf Gang, this is a sleeper!","1010":"I am only drinking it, so it won't be wasted, and I have to rotate it with a Coffee People product, so I remember why I like coffee.  It is really wan. The strongest flavor profile is tin.  I love creme caramel and am a huge WP fan, but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. Choose another - you won't be sorry you did.","1011":"My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one.","1012":"I love Wolfgang Puck products but the coffee is very disappointing. There is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted! Some troll must have changed out all the real Puck products! Libbie","1013":"This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder.","1014":"I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.","1015":"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it.","1016":"I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.","1017":"I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.","1018":"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this.","1019":"The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  I'm going to stick to Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now.","1020":"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours.","1021":"I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.  It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross.","1022":"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more \"class.\"  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!","1023":"The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.","1024":"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee.","1025":"I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.","1026":"This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had! I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring. Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!","1027":"Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...","1028":"This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.","1029":"This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.","1030":"No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.","1031":"The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!!","1032":"I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.","1033":"this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good","1034":"Wolfgang Puck's \"Breakfast in Bed\" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one.","1035":"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page.","1036":"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As \"flavored\" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable.","1037":"I purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box. I contacted Amazon and they sent two more out, these also arrived with the packages open. Amazon was very courteous and professional as always, I cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that I have given up on trying again.","1038":"SORRY, AS I STATED ON MY OTHER REVIEWS MY GERMAN BREED, G.SHEPH. IS VERY PICKY...AND HE JUST DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL OF THESE BEEF ROLLS, HE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO COME CLOSE TO TAKE 2ND SNIFF....SORRY, NO STAR!!! BUT IT TRIGGERED ME TO GIVE IT AS LEAST 1 STAR TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW.","1039":"licorice  has  no  flavor very hard  to eat it was in a seal  bag  but  it  hard  not soft like other  licorice","1040":"These pods are rather bland. I purchased them because I thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. They do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. I would not purchase them again, nor do I recommend them.","1041":"This batch was horrible.  Since most regular coffee were out of stock, I tried this one.  It tastes and smells awful.  Do not buy this flavor.","1042":"The particular packages had an off taste. However, the seller gave me a complete refund and didn't even make me send them back. I have ordered this item before and they were fine.","1043":"We have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past, but this order is inferior.  Did the company change hands or outsource their production?","1044":"Hi, coffee doesn't smell or taste great. I recommend Senseo Vienna. Still have packages of \"Paris\" and nobody wanna drink it. Guess I just have to throw it away.","1045":"They kept raising the price. The product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price. This last order I have had enough and will be going back!","1046":"This jam has little fruit taste. If you love damson jam this is not the one for you. It could have been any flavor. All you taste is sweetness.","1047":"After a few uses, this powder spoilt a cake. It has lost its raising power. It is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place. Avoid this one. I plan to ask for a refund.","1048":"I opened the box to find a huge mess of chocolate all over the tray. Chocolate was no better than Hershey's and worst of all, it is imported from Hong Kong. I don't care to eat food made in China after all their countless product safety issues. Look elsewhere","1049":"This is the first review I have ever done, but I could not let this one go bye. This was the worst ever, save your money.","1050":"I think I'm not a green tea drinker.  This is pretty awful tasting stuff.  Glad I bought just one bag, because I'm throwing it out.","1051":"This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again","1052":"If you are looking for a sugar high, then these are what you are looking for. Too sweet for me and my family, I don't think we will be ordering these again.","1053":"Hi, I am very disappointed with the past shipment I received of the ONE coconut water. 3 of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled.  Thanks.  Laks","1054":"MY Fondarific Buttercream Wedding White Fondant, 5-Pounds IS as hard as concrete!!!!!!! I just received this today, I can't use it, obviously, I have a wedding on Saturday, what should I do? HELP! This a non return item, what should a customer do?","1055":"I was excited to see that Amazon is selling 100% Kopi Luwak. However, these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. I'm guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag.","1056":"I bought this to take a check mark off of the bucket list, but my wife and I had a cup of this and both of us immediately got sick with a headache and vomiting profusly. What made it worse it's Christmas and this day is shot now. We're coming through it but I'm sorry to say but my bucket list was almost over before it got started. Try if you want but it's made us sick and almost in the hospital. This is a Christmas I'd like to forget.","1057":"There was no seal of any kind on jar. Cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out. Would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went.","1058":"I ordered  Smoke paprika, unfortunately i received regular sweet. I called and spoke with a gentleman, who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made. Until today (1 month maybe 2 later) still haven't received anything or heard from the company. Very disappointed.","1059":"I guess everyone's taste buds are different.  This product didn't work for me.  Every food item tasted as it should :-(","1060":"Dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on ANY of the foods that I tried.","1061":"After taking a tab, I was able to eat a hot pepper, but it didn't really taste sweet or good at all, just not very hot.  Then I tried some cayenne pepper, which remained hot with no alteration in taste.This is a nice idea, but didn't work for me.","1062":"Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the \"mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets\" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry \"Believers of Miracles\"... this is one that won't make \"The Tonight Show\"!","1063":"I'm jealous of whoever thought of this, but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. It turns out, if you eat half a fruit roll-up, then eat asparagus, the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect.  There. That's all you need to know.  DON'T buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time you're at Wal-Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers.","1064":"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE.","1065":"It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.","1066":"These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill\/tablets. In my opinion.","1067":"I've tried this with multiple foods, at different times, and with anywhere between one and three tablets, all held on different areas of the tongue. While I could swear there were minor changes at low quantities, this didn't change no matter how many were tried. I'm sure that the Miracle Berries are authentic, but my friend and I didn't experience anything as incredible as people say, or even anything noteworthy. I would go for the actual fruit next time.","1068":"I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.  This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.  I would not suggest this version of the product, other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries.","1069":"Quite disappointed. The pills don't last that long (it wears off after a few tries per pill) and not all the food items on the suggested list works. E.g. Cheese. Maybe it was a bad batch, but I'm not taking the risk to purchase it again.","1070":"Worked very little. Sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter. A sour orange it did help. It didn't work on anything else at all.","1071":"First of all, these things taste pretty bad. If you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue, maybe it wouldn't be AS bad. But I really didn't notice much change in the taste of foods. Lemons tasted sweet, but that's all I noticed. I considered trying two at a time, but they just tasted so bad to me that I have never used them again.","1072":"My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was.","1073":"I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we'd seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever. We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead.","1074":"After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.  After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.  Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again.","1075":"I'm a huge Stephen's fan but I'd only ever had the regular Milk Choc hot cocoa.  Deciding to be a little more health conscious I thought I'd try the fat-free variety.  DON'T! :)  Okay, if you aren't expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it.  It's much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesn't do justice to regular Stephen's Hot Cocoa.  I'm going back to the good stuff.","1076":"I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I don't know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate..","1077":"I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).  Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.  Stephen's chocolate has bad\/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.","1078":"I love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones, but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate I have ever tasted!! I was hoping it would be good so I bought 2 cans. After 1 cup, I threw both cans away. If you want a really great cherry hot chocolate, add 3-4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate. YUM!!! Add more if you use dark hot chocolate.","1079":"Unfortunately I didn't notice this until I received the product.  I guess I'll be giving it away to friends & family that don't mind it.  Tastes artificial like coffee creamer.  Ingredients Sugar, Sweet Whey, Maltodextrin, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Corn Syrup Solids, Non-fat Dry Milk, Natural & Artificial Flavor, Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Salt, Mono and Diglycerides, Dipotassium Phosphate, Carrageenan, Soy Lecithin.","1080":"The company does not operate properly I ordered the French Vanilla.  That is the selection I clicked on and I recieved the White Chocolate. They should contact a buyer BEFORE shipping a substitution.","1081":"Price was misleading, once the high shipping rate was added, the tea was no longer the 'deal' it was promoted to be. Although once it finally arrived, it was half decent tea, but NOT worth the shipping and the wait, will go to my local tea house next time.","1082":"I have orderred Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Organic Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee more than 5 times however the last lot I received with really bad quality. Lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. Hope the seller can check what happen...I may not try it again.","1083":"Love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet. I gave this to my Mother who loves sweets and she said she couldn't eat it either. Need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar","1084":"First, the product pictured is not what you get.  What you really get is are tiny packets called \"sticks\" suitable for flavoring bottled water. The box doesn't even say what size bottle it is sized for.  I'm not keeping it so I can't tell you how it tastes.","1085":"I was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate. If you want the BEST, I've found that Ethel M.'s chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good - but you WILL pay the price!","1086":"I love liquor-filled chocolates.  I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.","1087":"I meant to order Anthony Berg's chocolates and got this one by mistake...yikes, not a good outcome.  The chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse...don't make the mistake that i made...","1088":"You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? That's how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didn't taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies weren't fresh.","1089":"Bottom line, this made my cat projectile vomit. I've never had a problem with him eating Friskies before but, I knew \"Cheezy Craze\" just didn't sound right. It came as a sample in one of the larger bags. Not fun to clean up after partial digestion.","1090":"I love chia, but I have gotten two different packages of this brand that were rancid.  The expiration dates were over a year away.  Amazon doesn't allow food returns, and Navitas said I would have to ship them the seeds for them to check before they would send me new ones.  I will still enjoy chia, but I'll avoid this brand from now on.","1091":"I bought Nutiva organic chia seeds before, two pouches 14 ounces each - $16.24 with tax, this brand in one 16-ounce pouch $14.83. The quality and the taste are the same, but the latter one is WAY much more expensive. Buy Nutiva Organic Chia seeds, not Navitas. In terms of the taste, I usually toast mine and add them everywhere - cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. Tastes great and full of fiber.","1092":"I bought this product not that many months ago and loved it BUT no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price! I bought it for $10 originally. Will buy another brand.","1093":"This was the first time I tried purchasing a food product over the internet, and as feared I was sent something other than what was pictured.  This package contains Chia Seed POWDER, which I assume is ground up seed (or the remainder from packaging whole seeds) that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler.  Not going to bother returning a $7 product, but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds.","1094":"I was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. Its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. Kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste. I finally ask myself why am I eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they don't seem to like it much either.","1095":"we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves. it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake. we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now. her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal","1096":"This is a great product... my baby loves it. I especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly.  I am, however, rating this low because of the SELLER... $55 is RIDICULOUS! This product normally sells for $25-$32. But they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall.  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AMAZON!!!! This is food for a BABY! Makes me ill.","1097":"I have been searching for a natural lemonade drink mix that would actually taste good.  This is not one of them.  Did not like the the bitter taste of this drink mix. I can make my own fresh squeezed lemonade better than this stuff.  In the mean time I purchase Newmans Own ready made lemonade if I don't have the time to make my own lemonade.","1098":"I got a call from my mother-in-law last night thanking me for her birthday present I ordered here. She thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted. She asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her. I said no and felt bad a 93 year old lady ate some bad jelly beans.  Won't buy again,  Steve Baker","1099":"Be careful if you have a chocolate allergy.  The last box I purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown.  I know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color.  The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesn't list ingredients.","1100":"I ordered and got seeds.  Called, got a refund and reordered... got seeds.  I'll have to order the sprouted chia seed powder elsewhere. :)","1101":"Ugh, this stuff may be good for me but it's not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while, and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didn't notice any obvious effect and I've slacked off.","1102":"I did not enjoy this soup; I will try a different brand next time.","1103":"I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory. It had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. For the money I paid for it I was quite displeased and will NEVER buy from them again.","1104":"I recently ordered the 16 oz., 3 Pack.  When my FedEx order arrived on December 26, 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order.  I would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1\/3 of my $105 charged price.","1105":"I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop?","1106":"I am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first.  But like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth.  And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didn't do that).  Nice idea but I don't think I will buy these again.","1107":"I was so excited to receive the product I immediately cooked a bag.  What a disappointment!!  The taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that I didn't enjoy.. I couldn't finish the bag!  My dog wouldn't eat them either ans she eats everything - including brusell sprouts!  I have had microwave pork skins that were good but I don't remember the brand so I'll just have to do without","1108":"A terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds.  We only got pieces of pork skin","1109":"But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench\/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I can't say I would let the guests of my home try these so I can't recommend them here to anyone.","1110":"Too salty. But that was not even the worst of the problems. It has a weird texture (I cooked it perfectly) and tastes horrible. If you haven't eaten pork rinds before, please stay away. Even the worst popcorn tastes better.","1111":"was really dissappointed in product... too salty and poor flavor....Convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds...","1112":"Lowrey's has changed it's microwave pork rinds. I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product. I will buy no more Lowrey's microwave pork rinds.","1113":"Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.  I don't know what good the 'popping' does except make them sort of hot. They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor).","1114":"I don't know if I got a bad batch or something, but I could'nt get these to cook right. I followed the instructions and after about two minutes, the bag stoped expanding. I opened it and found everything badly burnt. the next bag I waited about one and a half minutes. I opened it and found half the chips uncooked. I never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt. (I shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time)","1115":"They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn\/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag.","1116":"I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. I even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. I carefully followed directions for each bag. If I could rate this, a zero I would.","1117":"I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldn't.  They did not seem to \"pop\" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didn't taste very good.  I will not be buying these again.","1118":"I've bought this product many times and this time (11\/10) they are old or defective.  The bags don't puff up and rinds are flat, stale & burn when cooked.  I've tried different time settings and in different microwaves.  I'm very dissapointed as this is a product I've been ordering for years.  Guess I'll have to call them and complain.","1119":"Yuck, these do not taste good and they are quite tough. Better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired.","1120":"too much MSG gives it a nasty salty after taste.  i basically gave them away.","1121":"OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.","1122":"Could not get the bags to \"pop\" any edible pork rinds.  I tried several bags with no results.  I finally had to throw them out.  I was very dissapointed with this product.","1123":"I hated the flavor of this product, I ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends.","1124":"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch of salt would have been better.","1125":"The bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un-popped and extremely over-salted.  This product is inferior to other brands I have tried.","1126":"Not one member of my family, including me, like these extremely salty, much too strong a BQ taste to order more.  I purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now.  I have received only one shipment. Cancel further shipments.  Not to our taste at all. These are Lowery pork rinds.","1127":"The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.","1128":"So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out.","1129":"Horrible \"hemical\" taste.Extremely salty !!!!!!  This was a complete waste of money,after the first bag I will have to throw the whole box away !!!!!!!!","1130":"I tried to \"cook\" 6 different bags of these.  Only a fraction of product \"popped up\".  The ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor.  Unfortunately, they were not returnable, so the rest will be going to the trash.  Waste of $$$.","1131":"I ordered this product - Lowry's Pork Rind - and received it promptly - within two days.  I have not been able to pop one bag!  They all stay flat - nothing works.  My microwave is not the problem as I cook lots of other things in it.  Looks to me that the product is not longer any good, by the comments.  They may have started out great, but it NO LONGER IS WORTH BUYING!","1132":"This is my first time and I can't eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. Is there something wrong with my batch? I can't eat them or they would break my teeth am I doing something wrong I only cook them 1 min.","1133":"These pork rinds contain MSG which is not stated on the listing.  Deceptive listing for this product.  Will not purchase again.  Shame on Amazon for wasting my money.","1134":"They were very salty and seasoned with a seasoning that my family and myself did not like.  I shared with co-workers and they did not like them either.  We still have the balance and hate to pitch them but if we can not find someone who likes them that we can give them to we will.  I think they were awful","1135":"I was so excited when I heard about this product. I love pork rinds. But these have a nasty chemical smell and they really don't taste good at all. Don't waste your money. I actually threw the remaining 17 packages away. They REALLY SUCK!!!!","1136":"These pork rinds by Lowery's suck.  I have tried to leave a review, but it appears that Amazon.com has their heads as far up their a**es as Lowery's.  I don't expect to see this posted.","1137":"This is a great idea but just like baking a cake...you can't do it in a midrowave.","1138":"I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag, it's impossible to even want to put yourself through that again.  They are nasty!!!  Avoid them at all cost!!  Yuck!!","1139":"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch would have been better, or no salt at all.","1140":"I am a lover of pork rinds so i was really looking forward to eating fresh ones, neathers to say they dident cook in 5 mins like it says it would and if you put it in that long most would burn to a crisp by that time, another thing that really dident appel to me is that the taste is like they poured tones of salt on them before they packaged them.... i wanted to eat pork rinds NOT salt, if i wanted to salt i would just get it from the salt in my seasons cabnet...very disappointed...","1141":"In all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product.  I purchased it based upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately, the smell (oil I am assuming) of it cooking made me feel ill.  Even though the product cooked perfectly, the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day.","1142":"I considered buying these but the health risks should be considered.  These are cured, stored with salt, and have nitrates.  If you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns.  you can still eat well when avoiding such things.","1143":"I recieved my bacon crisps. The price is OK, but I did not order hot & don't know how to change my subscription.","1144":"Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.  Because I didn't first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities\/allergies to avoid this product.","1145":"This is my fourth order of these pork rinds and I'm not sure what's up, but something's really amiss.  The bags are leaking some kind of grease and don't fluff up during the microwave process.  I used to love these, so hopefully this is just a bad batch.  If not, then Lowrey's needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack.","1146":"This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon.","1147":"I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1\/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions...","1148":"Not thrilled with this one - threw most of it away.  For some reason, the result ended up being \"gummy\" which isn't something I expected from this type of product.","1149":"first, the good news:  YES, these are really good. the bad news: They are loaded with monosodium glutamate Of course, this wasn't listed on Amazon as one of the ingredients. This is a good item if you're not sensitive to MSG-- Now I have to go to the 7-11 and buy the fried pork rinds to feed my addiction.","1150":"Someone at work cooked these and the smell is now making everyone sick. Smells kinda like puke. Hopefully the smell does not last overnight. Not recommended.","1151":"Terrible. Half of the rinds don't cook and the ones that do are gummy and shrink. Contacted Lowrey's about the defective product but they failed to respond.","1152":"Wow, I had high hopes for a great addition to my low carb diet, but these rinds were very disappointing.  Tried several bags, but could not get the cooking time right.  Taste was dreadful, texture downright rocky.  I guess I'll stick to off the shelf rinds.  Won't be getting these again.  Can't recommend, and would warn of anyone asking for my opinion.","1153":"I am having probs with the cooking. They come out all fluffy and in 20 seconds suck back into themselves and get all hard. I've tried less time, more time and cooking them out of the bag on a paper towel... Dunno what I am doing wrong, and the company doesn't have any contact info. As for the taste..they're Alright..Waay salty and I'm a salt-a-holic!  I wouldn't buy again :(","1154":"I saw these on the Food Network Channel, and they made it sound so delicious on TV. I only wanted to buy one or two packets to try, but Amazon only sells them in a big box.  They're light and crispy if they're popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers). Not all of the bacon chips pop, and you can't eat the ones that don't because it's like plastic before they're nuked in the micro.  Now, I am stuck with the rest of the box.","1155":"I expected better. Flavor is o.k. But half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave.","1156":"I think this chunky chili is the worst store-bought chili.  The meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy, the sauce is too sweet and cloy.  This has no character.  I prefer Hormel or Dennisons to this.  By far.","1157":"When cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about 1:15 secs in my microwave, WTF? It has done it to me three times in a row, then I tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem. I'm not sure this stuff is even safe!","1158":"Kind of  a ripoff.  I bought the theater box instead of the 5 piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake.  Each box has only 8 or 9 pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even 1 piece of each flavor.  One box had 6 green pieces and 3 black.  A better value is 20 pack of the original 5 piece bar.  This theater box is sold by weight (4oz) and not volume.  The box is about 90% empty- Ripoff!","1159":"I was very disapointed with these flowers. Several of the  stargazer buds were damaged, as if they had been frozen, and several others are such that they will not  open very well, although there is still time for them to improve perhaps. But, the number of flowers for the money was wholly inadequate. On the bright side, the Iris' are blooming nicely and are beautiful. Based on the condition of the stargazers, and the inadequate number of stems,however,  i do not think I will order from this company again","1160":"This company is a sponsor of the Rush Limbaugh radio show.  This means that Proflowers pays for and profits from Mr. Limbaugh's hate speechs against women and non-Caucasian people.","1161":"I bought this based on the rave reviews posted previously -- but one of the main ingredients is MSG. There's gotta be a way to make a good BBQ rub that's not loaded with the stuff, which gives me and my wife nasty headaches.......","1162":"I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion. This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.","1163":"Love this cereal, but I buy  a 35 oz box at Costco for $7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $2 \/box coupon. Its too high here","1164":"This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies.","1165":"This is awful.  So, I got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt, little sugar and no butter fat tomato Soup using fresh tomatoes.  Tastes much, much better than this Tomato Soup!","1166":"This is not the product I received.  They changed the product.  It now has chunks of tomato in the soup.  This is not what I wanted.","1167":"Actually I can't remember a time when I tasted anything so bad. I really could not believe it was meant to be eaten. Cannot imagine anyone liking this.  It did give me a good example for my daughter why it is important for her to take her health seriously.","1168":"I received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out.  I have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and Namaste brand products have been a Godsend to our family.  Unfortunately this \"Say Cheez\" product is terrible and my child wouldn't touch it.  Normally, this isn't a problem when my child tries new foods, but I couldn't even stomach it!  It is NOTHING like mac & cheese.  The sauce isn't even creamy?!?!  Very disappointing.","1169":"After trying the Namaste pizza crust I was blown away--Delicous!  Possibly, the best pizza crust I've ever had.  So, I tried their Cheez Pasta thinking it would be great as well.  Big surprise.  It was awful.  I could barely tolerate one bite of it.  I, like one of the other reviewers, will save the pasta but make my own cheese sauce.  The cheese sauce smelled and looked terrible.  Do not waste your money on this product!","1170":"When we found out my daughter has celiac disease, we were on the hunt for a reasonable mac&cheese. We tried everything we could fine. This was one of the worst. The cheese flavor was pretty bad. I took one bite and had to spit it out. My daughter didn't like it either. I am keeping a spreadsheet of items we tried so we don't waste our money on it again in the future. The best mac&cheese we found was Annie's rice pasta and cheese.","1171":"I ordered 18 bags of York Pieces for wedding favors, half of the bags were melted and Amazon has a no return policy on food items. I would not order food products from a online vendor again.","1172":"I had high hopes for this product...just to be completely let down by the broken lids on both jars which let the ghee leak all over the shipping box!  It was shipped with broken lids from the seller because the 2 pieces of broken lid were NOT in the box!!!!!!!!!!  I will NEVER buy anything from this seller again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BE WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The ghee was runny, probably from sitting in storage at the seller's business with air getting to the product through the broken lids.","1173":"the lime flavor is too much, didnt think it would be so strong. its ok but there are much better flavors to be had. would not buy again.","1174":"This quinoa has to be rinsed!  I would not have ordered it if I had known that.  There are many other brands for the same price that DON\"T require this annoying and messy step.","1175":"I like this coffee, but $37 for two 12-ounce bags? I can get it online from Walmart or even from my local grocery store for $7-9 per 12-ounce bag. Geez.","1176":"Gimme better ingredients (KIND\/Larabars) for more $ or sweeter items (genuine junk) for less $. Not sure I'd invest in a single bar again, let alone this size.","1177":"I found the tarallini to be crumbly and have an unpleasant stale taste. My previous experience with tarallini was different, they were crunchier and not crumbly. Whether this is a specific mediterranean recipe, I don't know, but I would not buy this product again.","1178":"I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection).","1179":"This tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade; it was totally dried out when I opened it.  When treacle sponge pudding dries, it smells nasty and can't be reconstituted, even with water and some heat.  Total waste of money.","1180":"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore.","1181":"The hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it.  I will not be buying this product again, and will probably not consider any more green mountain products.","1182":"I used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste.  This did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it.","1183":"I don't like this product at all.  Much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from Nestle or Swiss Miss.","1184":"This product would be better made with milk, which of course, then would not be for the Keurig machine. There are other brands I prefer.","1185":"This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. It's not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better.","1186":"Yuck...WORST \"CHOCOLATE\" I have ever had. Save your money on this brand and find another. Doesn't even taste taste like chocolate; we threw the rest away.","1187":"I've been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isn't great.  It's not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom.","1188":"Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate.","1189":"The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15.","1190":"I had high hopes for the convenience of this product.  My daughter LOVES hot chocolate. This really was a total disappointment.  I threw these kcups out.  If you use the smallest setting on your Keurig, you get 3 oz of watery hot chocolate.  Larger settings are not drinkable.  Save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa - and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides.","1191":"I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good).","1192":"This product was not very good at all. It did not have the taste or consistency of the wanted beverage.","1193":"Very disappointed in this.  Heed the bad reviews.  I am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down.  Need to dump some Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point, what was the purpose.  With the product already being overpriced (shop elsewhere)as it was and tasting watered down; it just wasn't worth it.  Skip it!  Maybe a different brand will be better.","1194":"Even though the little ones liked this product, I thought it was bland and not much flavor to it.  I will not buy more of these.","1195":"This time, forget ordering through Amazon.  You can get the same product, 24 K-Cups for $12.75 at Big Cat or for $14.80 at Keurig.  These prices are a rip off.","1196":"I used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting.","1197":"Even after shaking the cup and only using 6 ounces of water, this \"hot cocoa\" (pretty sure there's not a lick of real chocolate in it) still tastes horrible.","1198":"Received a Keurig brewer for Christmas and also received a pack of this hot \"chocolate\" with it.  We made some after sledding one day for myself, my husband and 2 kids (6 and 10) all thought it was terrible.  We almost returned the Keurig brewer because of it.  I have found that I am enjoying black coffee with my Keurig, but we will never buy any type of hot chocolate k cups again.","1199":"I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product.","1200":"I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!","1201":"Don't waste your money. Buy the real cup of coffee and spend the time and money at a coffee shop.","1202":"This is the very worse BBQ suace I have ever tasted and bought. I saw the man v Food  show which featured the stomach bile tasting thin sauce and then bought it ...wow  Texas really doesn't know BBQ sauce.","1203":"We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking.","1204":"I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.  For the price I consider it a poor value. Taste is OK but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey.","1205":"Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy.  Although this gives you less fat, there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB...","1206":"I like creamy peanut butter, however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat. Kinda makes for a messy sandwich.","1207":"I bought this by accident, then decided to give it a chance.  Not worth it, I would rather have less real peanut butter than eat this.  It has a gritty consistency because of the sugar and tastes too sweet and not \"pea-nutty\". It was more sugary sweet than tasting like peanut butter and the gritty texture just turned me off, maybe because it was creamy? I would like to find a PB with less fat but still enjoy it, this was not it for me.","1208":"For the uninitiated, 'evaporated cane juice' is just sugar by another name. Another product that tries to present itself as healthy, but isn't really...eating something that lists sugar as the second ingredient isn't what I would consider to be a healthy start for the day.","1209":"At the time of purchase, the production description stated:  Blue Diamond Natural Cinnamon Brown Sugar Oven Roasted Almonds 8 oz by Blue Diamond Be the first to review this item  Like (0) List Price: $32.55 Price: $6.82 ($0.12 \/ oz) You Save: $25.73 (79%)  Product Description Blue Diamond Almonds Oven Roasted Cinnamon Brown Sugar - 6 Pack  Both the list price and description suggests that it is a 6 Pack.  I ordered 2 and received 2 \"1 packs\". This is a single 8 oz container.","1210":"This is basically candy masquerading as a \"healthy\" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!  I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.","1211":"I purchased 2 other types of Blue Diamond almonds on the same day, and they were both around $11 for a pack of 3. T his one was only ONE 8 oz. container, and I assumed it was at least 2-3 containers since the cost was over $8.","1212":"These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier.","1213":"All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good!","1214":"These taste good and are edible but I am only giving 1 star to let people know that this product tastes like Pistachios to me, not almonds. I don't know why. If I wanted Pistachios I would've bought them. I had a craving for almonds and these just don't do the trick. They also contain a weird ingredient; CORN MALODEXTRIN. WHY?! They are ALMONDS! All you need is almonds and salt, maybe oil! So much for being \"All natural\".","1215":"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS.","1216":"I am looking for a replacement for Coca Cola and I read the positive reviews here and decided to purchase at my local Whole Foods. There's a gross stevia aftertaste and it tastes nothing like commercial cola; it's not good and it's misnamed.","1217":"This is a rip off.  Found out that you can buy this product for under $2.00 just about anywhere, not the $7.99 they charge.  In fact you can go directly to the manufacture and order.  Do not get rip-off.","1218":"I've been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by \"Fine Tea\" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother-in-Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas.","1219":"This tea was supposed to be loose tea.  I purchase loose tea all the time.  Instead of packaging the tea in bags, they left it loose.  Gave a very couldy tea with a bitter taste.","1220":"This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right.","1221":"According to an article on CNN.com on 8\/5\/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable. \"Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.  The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.\"","1222":"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how \"good\" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!","1223":"This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity.","1224":"I would not recommend this oil.  It does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin.  It's just like other oils I have bought from drug stores which were cheaper.","1225":"Do not order this! It has absolutely no taste and was COMPLETELY disappointing!I tried to return the unopened 5 boxes and Amazon would not let me...total bummer and waste of money.","1226":"Ingredients on Deep River Snacks's website are: Potatoes, sunflower oil and\/or corn oil, whey, sea salt, onion powder, sugar, garlic powder, torula yeast, dried parsley, maltodextrix, canola oil, soybean oil, rosemary extract and \"natural flavors\".  False adversing much?","1227":"The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Don't wast your time.","1228":"The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips.","1229":"This lemon salt is ok, but the salt is not infused with the lemon, the lemon is mixed with salt granuals.  So might as well use lemon.","1230":"I bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry, didn't have much chocolate, and left an unpleasant aftertaste. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. If these were the only GF cookies available, I still wouldn't buy them again.","1231":"These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed.","1232":"i was shopping for SUGAR-FREE cookies, so they suggested other SUGAR-FREE cookies and i selected them, unfortunately, i'm a diabetic, and when i received the \"lucy\" chocolate chip cookies: NOT only were they assorted flavors (Which i DIDNT order) BUT they were NOT SUGAR-FREE!! why would they suggest these i have NO idea,but i'm very upset.","1233":"I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.  They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.  There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.  Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.","1234":"These are the worst gluten free cookies I have ever tasted.  They were hard, dry and tasted like tapioca flour.  Avoid these at all cost.","1235":"I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.  The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.","1236":"These are good, though a bit too salty for my taste. But you can get these for about 40% less at any grocery store. Save your money!","1237":"These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top. I've bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty.  Maybe the machine went wacko when processing these. ??? I can't eat these unless I take the time to try and wipe off the salt, which talks forever!!","1238":"I bought Blue Diamond Natural Chocolate almonds before & 100% Natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day & i dont know if it's the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to.","1239":"When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.","1240":"A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more.","1241":"I bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a \"good\" steak at home. The first ones we cooked....could hardly cut with a steak knife. The second time we tried them, I tenderized for quite some time. They were more edible that way, but still nothing better than I could have bought at the local grocery store.  Except for the packaging, there is nothing good I can say about these steaks. If you figure the price per pound, these steaks should cut with a butter knife.  Will never buy again.","1242":"I ordered a box of the Omaha Steaks Top Sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather. Toughest meat I've ever had.  There was absolutely no flavor to the steak and I didn't want to waste it so I gave it to my dogs","1243":"Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again.","1244":"Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn.","1245":"I had already bought this product from another website before and I generally love it. However, the one I bought from this supplier tasted horrible and it also tasted like someone dropped ashes in it.  This comes with 12 packages and I opened 3 to make sure that it was not just a problem with the one package. Because this was so horrible, I could not bring myself to try the rest so the rest of it will be going into the garbage.","1246":"These aren't clearly labeled \"GLUTEN FREE\". They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. They are a weird flavor, sort of costly and not worth it. eew.","1247":"You get 12 bags for 12.00, in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. The taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag..","1248":"These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland.  Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor.","1249":"I've heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before.  I never quite knew what they meant until now.  This really does taste like cardboard.  I don't think I could give these a way.  They are trash.  Don't waste your money. Here is a better low carb sweet snack <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000ZT15EQ\">Blue Diamond Almonds Cinnamon Brown Sugar, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)<\/a>","1250":"The freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place, these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting...I have several bags you can have for free.","1251":"The first couple of bags were great. Really fresh, smooth, great taste. I thought I'd found the perfect coffee bean!! The next 5 bags .. stale. I canceled my order and went back to buying whole bean coffee from the supermarket. You pay a little bit more, but I've found that most of the time, the supermarket coffee is fresher. I prefer the taste of Weaver's but too many stale bags.","1252":"its not that this coffee sucks its that it doesn't begin to measure up to all the hoopla! its well balanced but thats about it & even a little old tasting nothing special in the least what sweet caramel finish? can't believe this is the same coffee the 5 star reviews are about","1253":"It's not an amazing tea. It's an \"okay\" tea. I buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and I get same result. I look for saving money. Will not repurchase.","1254":"This was gross. It lamb lund & smelled bad. There hard chips. My dogs Favorite is the Texas Taffy. Thats a winner. I cut it into peices. she LOVES THEM.","1255":"These are tasty enough for an emergency snack\/lunch--I keep a few in my file cabinet. But our local Meijer's sells them for $1.33 apiece. Even the discount price here is twice that.","1256":"We love Trader Joe's Just the Clusters Vanilla Almond Granola Cereal but were very disappointed with the quantity we recived for the price charged.  As a result, we returned same.","1257":"These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.","1258":"This product is a waste of money!  It is bitter bitter and salty salty. Save your money and by the peaches instead.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0040PYN86\">Libby's Unpeeled Apricot Halves in Pear Juice From Concentrate, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)<\/a>","1259":"Upon opening the package I thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months.  After brewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking brewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone.","1260":"In order for tea to be labeled \"decaff\" is must be under 0.4% caffeine when residue levels are tested.  A tea at 2% caffeine is not decaff.  Non-decaff tea is anywhere between 3-5% caffeine.  So ...  at 2% caffeine, this is a caffeinated tea, with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf.","1261":"These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.","1262":"Unfortunately, all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong.  These are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages (as stated further down in the description).  They are .08oz packages.  Very disappointed in this fact.  Cherryheads are tasty, though, and the shipping was fast.","1263":"These are from China and nowhere as good as those from Italy. Spend the extra money and get those from Italy.","1264":"Amazon pirated my personal image for their listing. It is not a stock image.  I created it and put my website name on it...LooneyStuff.com...for use on my website. I have asked them to take my image down from this listing.","1265":"This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.  The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat.  The \"meal\" is flaky.  The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places.","1266":"We purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests. The pretzels would not have been bad for anything else, but there were way too many broken ones... we would have had to buy five more barrels. My only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still haven't received our refund!","1267":"They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable.","1268":"DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal. The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like I'm eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE.","1269":"I tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage.  The cereal looks like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute.  It has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom.  The carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times.","1270":"Fiber one products actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says \"chicory root\" or \"inulin\" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.  So if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber, this product is for you.","1271":"Actually typed in \"smoked paprika\". This showed up so I ordered it and it is definatly NOT smoked!  Also, these bottles sell for 4.95 at Sam's. So, not only was it the wrong item but, I over paid also!","1272":"I was introduced to this brand in Aruba. This coffee is sold in Aruba's supermarkets and jar label is in spanish. When I found it at Amazon I was very excited. I was immediately disappointed after first cup. Coffee in Aruba is rich, tasty and very smooth. My wife and I had been enjoying this brand for more than 10 years. The coffee sold in US is complete opposite to same brand sold in Aruba. I don't know why the same brand would be so different unless it is a grey market product with a look alike label. .","1273":"It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy, threw it out and made my own.","1274":"my finicky cats wouldn't eat this food so I gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn't go to waste...","1275":"I was anticipating a fragrant unprocessed, minimally oxidized tea that is unique to all white teas. This tea could not be farther from that description. Heavily oxidized with a very strong smoky flavor. Not even palatable on a second flush. Please save your money and consider paying a few more dollars from a supplier such as Rishi or Specialteas","1276":"When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn't.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food.","1277":"I thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section, but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when I opened each bag.  Slim Jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good.","1278":"When I first took a bite, I seriously thought I was eating dog food.  These are disgusting.  I searched the bag for \"dog food\" and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons.  I don't know how anyone can like these.","1279":"this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni","1280":"this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni","1281":"They taste more like chemicals than meat.  I like a lot of jerky and meat sticks, but would not eat these.  The dogs liked them though.","1282":"Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 32-Ounce Bag (Purchased on 02\/19\/2009)  This was the worst product I have ever tasted. I have had many Oberto products, and this was nothing like what I've eaten before. Even my dog wouldn't eat them, they were so nasty tasting.","1283":"These quickly became dog treats!  Just nasty!  I don't even know how they can sell these for human comsumption!  Stay away!","1284":"Only good use for these would be: In case of poisoning, use to induce vomiting!","1285":"Very expensive and not worth the price. Try PurityFarm Organic Ghee, it's much cheaper and taste much better than this Ghee. Don't waste your money.","1286":"Cannot detect any difference from other ghees.  Also, their supposed 'free' sample is not really. They ship a tiny jar in a box through the mail and it costs about $2.00 in postage, something for the box and it costs you $4.99.  Very disappointed.  They should reconsider doing that because it taints all of their offerings.","1287":"The product came at the end of August with expiration date of 01\/07. As a result I could not eat it. Just waist of money","1288":"Why in the world would Amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested,  when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. Wish every state would wake up like California and ban all these cancer causing things.","1289":"There is a warning for this package that it has things in it that cause cancel!!!  Why would you put cancer in your food?","1290":"I like the idea of getting grains out of cat food, but using peas instead doesn't seem to be the answer.  Carnivores (at least my cat) doesn't tolerate peas.  Vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing.","1291":"Unfortunately my dear sweet cat did not think this food was so dear or sweet. She only ate it when she knew there would be nothing else and she NEVER finished what I gave her. She normally eats EVERY SINGLE BITE of her food but constantly turned her nose up at this. She really enjoys Bench & Field's Holistic Natural Feline Formula (from Trader Joe's) and also Purina's Naturals Cat Chow. Sorry, Halo, I REALLY wanted her to like this!","1292":"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it.","1293":"It taste okay, but they are  not soft and the taste doesn't stay very long. I wouldn't buy them again.","1294":"My kids loves Chips Ahoy! and I will have them once in a while as well.  But the kids refuse to eat them from this Family Size package.  Once I tasted them, I knew why.  They have an awful medicinal taste.  Really bad.  I don't what the problem is, but if you like Chips Ahoy, you will not like these.  Go elsewhere.","1295":"First of all, the tea is gross. It tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly, the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two (2.2lb) bags. NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BAGS (4.4LBS) of this junk. I want my 30 bucks back.","1296":"Product is good; my cats like it.  But the price just keeps climbing.  I will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food.","1297":"Tuna, as is well documented, absorb and store Mercury in fat.  Anything that eats that fat consumes Mercury. I wouldn't feed tuna to a child, and I'd recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood. How can it be safely fed to a cat? Regarding this brand of cat food, it's excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey.","1298":"Cost was $48 at time of review.  Only $25 at other sites .... buy elsewhere!  Sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two. I will be comparison shopping a little more now.","1299":"This sells for $29.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Add your 20% off coupon and you're good to go ...  I also had cabinet issues and returned it to BB&B.","1300":"When I received this item, I was very disappointed with it. It is rather cheap looking and I wouldn't want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out. Needless to say I boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund. Definitely not worth $25.00, but after seeing it I would have been equally disappointed had I paid only $10.00.","1301":"Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesn't open\/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I weren't terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it.","1302":"I have one of these and love it but I would never pay this much for it.  Got it a Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $24.99 and that was not a sale, just their regular price.","1303":"Drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface. The drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed. I would not purchase again.","1304":"Ordered 2 both had bent tracks and I actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out. But you get what you pay for....","1305":"Looks good, but does not open and close smoothly.  The drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track.  The tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out.","1306":"I've been looking at this holder since I saw it at the at my office. Today I found it at BB&B for $24. It works great but too expensive at Amozon.","1307":"I have tried many flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies, and until I tried this one, I liked them all.  The ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added..........but it's more than a touch. Unless you really, really love carrot cake, you might want to make a different flavor selection. My favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal.....I wish I could get it all year long. The oatmeal raisin is my second favorite. I wish I had ordered them instead of these morning glory.","1308":"There are WAY too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie...at least for my tastebuds.  Whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far -- to the point that it is actually nauseating.  Obviously, I won't be ordering this one again.","1309":"Honestly, with the amount of sugar in these, they are not much better than eating a 300 calorie regular cookie. I don't think these are that \"healthy.\" The cookies taste fine, but I won't repurchase.","1310":"I really wanted to like these, but I just found them to be to sweet\/sugary. I generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason, and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound.  Sadly its just to sweet tasting for me.  Special note: The packs I received Oct 2010 have 20g sugar, not the 17g listed in the Amazon nutrition section. There may have been a recipe change . . .","1311":"The cookies tasted too much like baby food prunes to be any good.  Also they included directions to freeze them when they arrived to keep them from spoiling.  I would never buy these again.","1312":"Not Kosher!!! Ignore the Symbol!!! They are NOT Kosher and NOT certified by any company!!! I contacted the company to confirm.","1313":"We picked these up based on the glowing reviews. My fault, my mistake. I believe they are WAY over-rated. Doesn't taste morning glory at all. Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal \"cookie,\" like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre-teen.  In addition, cookies arrived cracked, broken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first.","1314":"The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future!","1315":"I was disappointed by my first taste of Kopali Organics Chocolate Covered Dried Banana. The chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me. I was expecting more crunch, a drier banana. The banana did not taste of banana to me either. I will not purchase again.","1316":"It clearly states on the description, pack of 6!  But I only got 5!  And I cannot find how to complain about this.  I don't want to return.","1317":"Sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible.  USE CAUTION before buying this item since there are NO RETURNS and you might find yourself with a throw away.","1318":"I ordered 2 cases as always. Rvc'd the 2 cases and the crackers were saltless, tastless. Amazon was kind to send 2 more cases and they were the same. BLAH!  I have written the masnufacturer to let them know. Amazon has greta customer care.","1319":"The bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering, all intact and well packed.  However, there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo.  It is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown (part of the heart shape).  I would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly (for the area where I live the shipping was about $10 and the product itself $15).","1320":"Super Bubble is my very favorite gum, and very hard to find here.  The box I received was a real hit or miss.  More than half the gum was brick hard - totally unchewable.  I've never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed. I will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future, but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth.","1321":"I ordered this saffron after looking at seller feedback and assumed that since this is expensive it will be premium quality. But only after i put it in water for sometime, then the color of the flakes changed, and I realized that its a fake one. Dont waste your time on this.","1322":"It did not really taste like much, so I was able to add sauce without interrupting the flavor, however I could not get past the texture. I'd rather chew on rubber bands.","1323":"I would like to try this, however I do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of, did I miss something? They only say what it is not! Would really like to know.","1324":"The shipment was Prime but arrived in 5 days instead of 2. I love dark french roast coffee, but, this coffee tasted burnt and additionally, the flavor had overtones of trash Indonesian.  Not a pleasant experience.","1325":"this is not a review of the product, but the seller\/shipper. I ordered this on september 22nd. It is now october 9th and I still have not received the item.","1326":"The juniper plant I received died within a month of planting. After I did some research, I found that it does the best outside of the home, which Eve's Garden failed to mention in the product instructions. I gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted. I will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again.","1327":"The Bonzai I ordered came well before the estimated date...  however... the tree I got as a gift was TINY. Nothing like it looks like in the product picture.","1328":"I know others like salt more than I do but I am not on a salt free diet or anything like that.  I love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste.","1329":"The taste is bitter, the smell is atrocious, and they are not naturally smoked.  \"Aqueous natural smoke\" is a chemical stew injected into the fish.  For anyone thinking these are the real thing, all I can say is 'there is a sucker born every minute.'","1330":"These sardines are okay, nothing more.  Don't fall for it.  At $2.82 a tin plus shipping, the Bela Sardine from Portugal blows these out of the water.  You can purchase Belas for $2.45 a tin and maybe less if you find them sold in bulk.  What am I going to do with 11 more tins of a so-so sardine.  Ugh!","1331":"I adore sardines.  I'm used to the Bela brand, but decided to try these for variety's sake.  I opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food.  I tasted them anyway, but was totally grossed out.  In the trash it went.  Stick with Bela, super clean flavor, fresh and better sourced.  Totally different food product.  Try them with Siracha.","1332":"Ingredient list: Sugar, Acidity Regulator (including miscellaneous chemicals). No tea whatsoever. $22 for 18 oz. (500g) of sugar with apple flavor. Most expensive sugar in the market!! Health benefit? None! It comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. That's all. Nothing more.","1333":"I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).  It didn't taste like the original but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and so I will not be ordering it again.  This tea did not have the strength or zing of the original.  I'm upset still.","1334":"The eggnog was NOT eggnog - they should try another name, as this is misleading.  The cartons are REALLY DIFFICULT to open - I use a screwdriver.","1335":"PLEASE research, on the web! This product nearly killed my dog! All of Dogswell jerky treats are Poison!! Made in China! This Dist. does not seem to care he is killing our pets. Fda told me 70 dogs have died from these kind of dog treats. BEWARE! I have over 1,000.00 in vet bills. Amazon please don't sell this line to us, talk with the FDA,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001AJ1ULS\">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)<\/a> find another product made in the USA, before more of our furry friends get sick or die.","1336":"My dog loves chicken breast treats. That is, until I bought these. I'm sure this is simply a matter of taste. I don't know if the additives smell different or what's turning him off but he'll pick it up and then just drop it. He refuses to eat them at all.","1337":"I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.  Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.  The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food.","1338":"I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver. Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves.","1339":"Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine\/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.","1340":"Thought these were healthy treats, but found out that they are Made in China.  Noted on back of bag.  Concerned that it may fall into China made Jerky treats suspected to cause kidney problems in pets.","1341":"consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable, to low","1342":"I had bought this product last year my dog loved them, but... I subscribe to a couple of Bichon Frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from China I threw out what I had left for the outside critters in the forest.  I called Dogswell today and they verified that even though they say U.S. on them they are still coming from China.","1343":"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice.","1344":"Made in China, does anything else need to be said?  I used to buy them then noticed the label, I will not buy again.","1345":"My dogs loved this product and I was happy to spend the money on it, but now that it's made in China- thumbs down, what were they thinking? I'll never buy it again. There are better products made in the USA. If you care about the well being of your dog, you will avoid products made in China.","1346":"I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned.","1347":"I bought this product last week for our dogs, within a day both were vomiting and refusing food. Our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not. Taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats.","1348":"Used to subscribe to this item, as my dogs loved them, but I just found that they are made in china. I will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company.","1349":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001AJ1ULS\">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)<\/a>Dogswell chicken jerky is now made in China.  The FDA has warned against dog food products made in China.  Don't risk it!","1350":"I used to buy these all the time and had no idea the switched to being made in China! Not trusting this company anymore, they just lost another customer. BUYER BEWARE!","1351":"My dogs LOVE duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so I though I'd give the duck a try.  Bad idea.  The treat was too tough and stringy for my small female Westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting.  I order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the 6 bags.  I too hate the fact that these are made in China, but my little guys need extra condroitin and glucosamine so I'm back to the chicken formula.","1352":"My dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however I am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in China. It is NOT worth the risk to me, sadly to say I will have to find another brand.","1353":"My labrador LOVES all the treats from Dogswell ! However, all of the Dogswell Jerky treats I have come across are Made In China. As a dog lover, I cannot knowingly give my dog a product from China. It does say \"cage-free\", but really? I'm not sure. BUT DOGSWELL Jerky Bars are Made in the USA & my dog loves this just as much! So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too!","1354":"I wish I had come to the Amazon site before purchasing this product at my local Wegman's. The 'Product Of China' was printed so small it was easy to overlook. I am a little shocked that Wegman's (a local chain store known for quality) was selling these 'treats' in a big display. The half open package is going in the trash and unopened bag is going back to Wegman's for a refund and a piece of my mind.","1355":"I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats\/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.  I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese \"treats\"","1356":"I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again. It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick. AVOID!","1357":"My 8 year old Maltese loved these treats.  I didn't know about the FDA warnings until after he died from a \"mystery\" illness that started out as vomiting followed by lethargy.  He had been very healthy before.  The vet did a necropsy and said my dog's liver was severely enlarged and his kidneys were also affected.  Please don't feed your beloved pets ANYTHING made in China.  If I had known about the dangers, I would never have given these to my dog.","1358":"all of the veterinary products made in China are potentially dangerous to your pet.  Do not buy pet products made in China.  Along with the melamine issues of a few years ago, there have been reports of Salmonella on these so called \"treats\".  Additionally, there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis.  And Amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products.","1359":"As many others have noted, these treats made our dog extremely ill. We could not figure out what was wrong at first. Eventually we realized the treats might be making him sick. We stopped feeding him happy hips and he almost immediately got better. We threw them out. Stay very far away from this product.","1360":"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.  The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.  Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.","1361":"My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great \"treat\", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009! Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these \"treats\"!","1362":"Okay, a lot of chicken breast treats from China are causing dogs to be sick (see the FDA website for details).  This is not one of them, but when I started buying it, it was made in the USA.  Now it's made in China.  Although my dogs have long loved this treat, I'm in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country.","1363":"Plenty of articles have been written about the danger and disease's caused by Chinese made dog treats.  These treats are made in China.  Plenty of healthy USA made treats available.  Avoid these at all costs!!!  After the latest information was released, I tried to return to Amazon, but they said no.  Please do not buy these \"treats\".","1364":"Just a word of warning...This product is made in China where they may add a substance that can cause serious kidney problems in dogs. Read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in China - [...]. After reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in China, I am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the USA.","1365":"I don't trust dog treats made in China.  As an alternative, there's a good chicken jerky dog treat made by Goodness Gracious - in the USA and using 100% human grade chicken.  [...]","1366":"I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.","1367":"I bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews I checked the bag... made in China. I threw the whole bag away. I wish I would have read the reviews first!","1368":"I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.","1369":"STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search \"chicken jerky treats china\" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am \"fortunate\"... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal of 2007 that killed 1000's of our four legged friends...TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY.  I read that Dogswell was going to stop manufacturing in China tho dont know current status.","1370":"These treats literally made my dog sick, throwing up everywhere. And it wasn't a shock when i read the package which stated Made in China. Weren't chicken treats for dogs that are made in China recalled?","1371":"My dog loves these treats but we recently found out these are made in China. Chicken jerkey products from China need to be avoided. I threw out the rest of these as a result.  Stay away and buy something American made.","1372":"I have been giving my dog these treats for years, thinking I was giving her something healthy.  I took her to my vet because she has been having bladder issues.  That's when the vet told me not to give them to her because they were made in China.  She said dogs have been getting sick from eating jerky treats made in China.  I can't believe I have been poisoning my poor little dog!  I will never buy another food product from CHINA!","1373":"And they are DRASTICALLY lower in quality.  Do a brief search on the equivalent of the USDA or Dept of Animal Welfare in China.  Guess what?  No existo.  DO NOT BUY.","1374":"These had been my dog's favorite treats. BUT when she developed vomiting and diarrhea, the vet strongly suggested that I reconsider these treats because, quote, they have been tied to some serious health problems. She asked, are these the ones made in China?  I said yes, and she said she wouldn't take the chance.  I just threw the last (full) bag into the garbage. Please don't take a chance with your pup!","1375":"After finding out whats in Beggin Strips these were recommended to me by a client.  I am a dog groomer.  My Standard Poodle had two this morning and has been vomiting along with diarrhea all day..  enough said..","1376":"I ignored the other reviews about how these were now being made in China - I had checked the warnings and was comfortable that Dogswell hadn't been mentioned.  I've bought them many times, and my dog loves these treats!  Unfortunately, the most recent batch I got last week smelled really awful - like a mix of chemicals and rotten meat.  None of the bags I've gotten before smelled anything like this, and it was so strong that it filled my apartment with the odor.  I threw them out and would not recommend buying them.  It's not worth the risk.","1377":"do not fed your dog any happy hip = dogswell product - it is not safe - google it if your dog has eaten them regularly have the vet do blood work","1378":"Kamfen Noodle King -Beef flavored soup. This noodle soup comes in a carton waxed paper bowl. Included are noodles, and three flavor packets. You add boiling water after you add the packets of dehydrated vegetables, spices, and a paste of some sort.   The noodles were starchy, and there was little or no vegetable flavor. The beef taste was probaly beef bullion cubes. All in all, a soup with very little flavor and my guess, high in sodium.   There are much, much better ramen noodle soups available. You can cross this one off your list.","1379":"I have purchased numerous canned chicken products before, and of course none compare to real chicken.  However, that being said, this product's quality is considerably below that of most canned chickens.  Other canned chickens have large chunks of white meat, while this product is full of small discolored pieces with pieces of what appear to be skin or fat.  Considering the price is also higher than the store bought competitors, I can not recommend this product.","1380":"I bought this to ship to me in Afghanistan, since it would be easier than asking my wife to go to the grocery store and then to the post office. Good price and fast shipping, but now I have to order a can opener. The item image depicts a pull-tab can which was my main concern, but the package that arrived did not have these tabs. If this is your concern, like mine, then don't buy.  As for the taste or quality of the meat, well I'll just have to wait and see.","1381":"If you are going to take Noni take pure Noni, not one with juice added, I didn't read that it contained the raspberry juice","1382":"I have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst.  Instead, I recommend the Dove dark chocolate and the Russell Stover coconut.","1383":"I just bought the same two items at my local store for less, except they were not marked value pack.","1384":"These peanuts are rock hard.  I ate a handful of peanuts and got a bad stomach ache.  They don't taste bad, and not salty at all. I don't understand why they are so hard.  Ouch.  I love the peanuts from Costco.  They are also extra large and delicious but they never hurt my stomach.  Must go back to them.","1385":"I opened the box with the 3 cans of peanuts and all 3 cans had a large dent on the side. There was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. At least the peanuts were OK. Maybe we are being sold \"seconds\" through Amazon by this company. Buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company.","1386":"I love these - they taste great.  But I get them in the local Dollar Store. Two stars for the value, five for taste.","1387":"It isnt even wroth being sugar free. my stomach is aching and I am getting so much gas. I would rather stick with the normal werthers. I cant believe i bought 12 bags of this crap...","1388":"Well, I love hard candies, but not the sugar. My husband & I saw these and thought we'd found the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldn't eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didn't realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame.","1389":"I am a fan of Pamela's gluten free products and have been happy with all of them until I got the Raisin Walnut Cookies. I just received the order a couple of days ago. I've eaten four of the cookies and they are very good tasting. However, in two of the four cookies I found myself chewing what presumably was walnut shells! I could have easily chipped or broken a tooth.  Pamela's makes some great products but this one is \"risky\".","1390":"The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.  Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below.  It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here.  It was 65F here when the package was delivered.","1391":"I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.","1392":"Bahlsen Butter Cookies,4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG. Also i emailed not send me any cookie with EGGS","1393":"Bahlsen Delice Cookies, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG.","1394":"Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress.","1395":"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!","1396":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001EQ5M3Y\">Sadaf Pitted Prunes Black, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)<\/a>  This item was full of mold (fungus) on reciept!","1397":"The bag we received from Amazon had hollow biscuits and were harder than the ones we purchased from a local store.  Were these a reject batch?  Certainly over baked or dried out!  Our bichon had a hard time biting into it.","1398":"The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits.  It was weird ......  they just weren't solid like they should be.  I'm going to switch to another brand of grain-free dog bisquits now as there's no sense in paying for something I'm not getting (and these are expensive!)  And if it wasn't for the good packaging I'd wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I don't think that's possible.","1399":"These look very tasty and me being a candy freak i had to try them. To say the least i was extremely dissapointed. They have a chemical taste and the texture is like chewing glue. Very nasty, i would never eat or buy these again and that goes for any of the flavors.","1400":"Just be aware.....the first ingredient on the list is salt.  I don't find this product very peppery, hot or spicy.  It is a disappointment.","1401":"This is a very pretty container, and my granddaughter loved the blue color when mixed with water-- but--- it tastes more like coconut than chocolate-- should be labeled hot coconut drink.","1402":"This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you don't mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry.","1403":"While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children. If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?","1404":"I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat.","1405":"We ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles, but Amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping.  Unfortunately, even at 85 cents a bottle, we overpaid.  There is NO cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess.  Now we have 10 bottles of a below average product.  Save your money.","1406":"Absolutely NO cheese flavor at all. All you can taste is salt salt salt. Save your money and try something else.","1407":"If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's brand... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you...","1408":"I bought this at a local Albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised.  There is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product.  Even the salt flavor is off.  Avoid this product.","1409":"Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning.  It is more salt than cheese.  In fact it has very little cheese flavor left.  I will not be purchasing this product again.","1410":"This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. The items are small, smaller than they appear in the picture. I only paid $30, but I would not purchase it again. On the positive side, the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible.","1411":"Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth.","1412":"This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you.","1413":"Once again, Paragon has disappointed with this flavor. The Hawaiian Tropic, simply did not carry much flavor, and what you could taste was not pleasant at all. I do not recommend this syrup concentrate.","1414":"I bought these (plainer box) at a Whole Foods. Definitely not worth the $4.29 I paid for them. They're so... bland. Like someone lightly and I mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard. There are no vitamins added either. So there's little health value. They could've at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it. I'll probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips. I can't afford to just toss them. Will NOT be buying them again.","1415":"I bought this cereal for my kids (ages 6 and 7) who can't eat gluten any more.  They won't eat it.  I think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out.","1416":"OK, I can't stand these things, but my babies love them, so I gave it 2 stars, not one. First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids. And that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't taste like you were licking a cinnamon stick or putting a teaspoon of ground spice in  your mouth. For being \"all natural\" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better...","1417":"I was optimistic about this, but neither the people nor the dogs would eat this cereal.  We threw out all 6 boxes.","1418":"I wanted to try this, so I purchased it, however I was very disappointed. So you get 2 bags of popcorn and 2 bags of caramel for each servings. It takes about 10 minutes to mix  the caramel into the popcorn. Save the money and buy yourself a popcorn bag at your local grocery store and buy caramel in a jar and just pour on top of it plus it will cost you about 1\/4 of this product. The popcorn doesn't even look like the picture on the packaging!.","1419":"This item is really Season's brand of hearts of palm, not Asian Harvest.  Nevertheless, they are awful.  Extremely woody and very hard to chew on the outside layer, tender in the middle, with a terrible bitter aftertaste.  There are distributed by Manischewitz, a generally reliable vendor of food products.  This, however, is a travesty!  The comparison between these and the brand carried occasionally by Costco, SunPix, is like night and day.  SunPix are tender, smooth, and taste great.  These are the exact opposite.","1420":"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of \"sanding\" sugar.","1421":"This is not XAPP Recovery as is listed, it is XAPP Energy. The difference is that XAPP Energy contains caffeine.","1422":"We love the Merrick lines of food to mix in with the Nature's Variety dried kibble.  Our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it.  They aren't normally fussy eaters.  I have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him, but not this.  We'll stick to Wing A Lings, Turducken and Smothered Comfort.","1423":"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of \"sanding\" sugar.","1424":"Must say I am so bummed out when I bought the 3 pack of 'artificially flavored' wintergreen....(FIRST CLUE?) from another source to find; not only do I not have real sugar, I am getting blue dye too.  This is obviously not 'original recipe' as states on front of tin so, quit trying to sell it that way Wrigley!!

They are now terrible because of the changes that Wrigley has made to them.  Get rid of the color and put back the flavor.  I will not buy them again unless they are changed back.","1426":"I fully agree with the last few reviews. Altoids were ruined when they started adding food coloring. Wintergreen Altoids are horrible now. These were the ONLY mints I would buy, but I won't be buying them any more.  FAKE SUGAR, FAKE FLAVOR, FAKE COLOR = NO DEAL","1427":"I will not buy this product again. I cannot find the actual ingredients, Natural and other flavors are not sufficient for people with allergies. So far the peppermint is OK if I do not buy the minis. I may just stop buying Wrigley products in general when finding ingredient lists is this difficult.","1428":"I have been a fan of Wintergreen Altoids for years.  When my last 12-pack ran out, I picked up a 2-pack of tins at a local store.  These taste nothing like they used to, and in fact taste nothing like wintergreen at all.  This flavour is like a combination of peppermint and ozone.  I will not be buying any more until they follow Coca-Cola's example and bring back a \"Classic\" formulation.  Neither will I be consuming the remainder of this most recent package.","1429":"i did not want this item and it was placed in my order by error and the item cannot be canceled.  This is unacceptable when I do not want the item.  How can this be taken off my bill?","1430":"They refuse to ship this fine tea to Canada.  I have to go to the Middle East to find it and bring it back.","1431":"I opened a can and it smelled like cigarettes which I was informed was bad bacteria.  I reported this to Amazon whom I got it from and they sent me another 6 pack for replacement BUT it also smelled badly...At this point I gave up trying. I am all for organic but this stuff was poor in my opinion.  Allot of it seemed like hard rice and it smelled like cigarettes and bad bacteria.  I wouldn't buy it again.","1432":"Think carefully before ordering this product. My experience wasn't good. I don't care for the taste and it gave me unpleasant indigestion. Perhaps some people can digest this stuff, but not me. You have to buy two at a time so it's a risk if you don't like the taste or if it gives you digestion problems, because IT'S A NON-RETURNABLE ITEM. Obviously, many people are fine with this product, but caveat emptor.","1433":"The taste and consistency of the Nutive Hemp Shake were great.  It's packed with fiber, protein, and nutrients and with only 80 calories per serving.  Unfortunately, the shake did not agree with me, and it gave me terrible gastrointestinal distress.  I had horrible bloating and foul gas from it, and I had to discontinue drinking it.","1434":"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad!","1435":"Maybe I'm asking too much---but I am trying to find a nondairy organic protein powder that would replace the whey protein I'm using in my morning shakes. Thought I'd give it a try-- my normal shake has the protein powder\/shake mix, as well as kale and blueberries, and I usually love it--- with the nutiva hemp shake mix, it was in edible-- adding banana didn't help much-- bad with a really wicked aftertaste. I may be expecting too much, but I'm going to keep looking!!!!!!","1436":"I have tried a lot of different powders, and while I like that this one has fewer calories, the taste is just not that good. It's hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.  There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders.","1437":"The taste is less then desired. I ordered three canisters all together and can't return them. My suggestion to anyone that wants to try it is to order just one and see how they like.","1438":"The flavor is not very good- tastes very artificial. Also I seemed to get a stomache ache after using the product, and I see in the reviews that I'm not the only one. Its only redeeming quality is that the texture was fairly good, in that it dissolved well into soymilk. Otherwise it would have only been one star.","1439":"I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste.","1440":"The taste is not real great and the protein level is really low.  I definitely prefer Amazing Grass Green Superfood Chocolate to this product.","1441":"The meat tastes GREAT. Unfortunately the shipping was 4 times the cost of the meat. I had looked into buying this 2 months earlier but never finished the order because of the outrageous shipping cost. Then I was placing a quick order for schoolbooks for my son and this was still in my cart. I had forgotten about the shipping cost and ended up buying it. I didn't find out until it arrived that I had paid $79 shipping for a $20 product.  On a positive note, it was delicious.","1442":"This honey is good. But I can't understand why the price is changed so frequently. One month ago I bought it at Subscribe price 34USD. This time I bought it at Subscribe price 40.83USD. But now it is 39.86USD. From the price aspect I don't recommend it.","1443":"Those silly elves...they actually think that cardboard is tasty! Well, we'll see if our bird friends like 'em. Hopefully, they do not pass away after ingesting these travesties of the Keebler realm. I know that I would. The box they come packed in probably tastes better. Give these to your children when they annoy you...they will never act up again, nor ask for ice cream ever again. O.K., I'm done.  Update, 9\/1\/11, 12:01 PM: The birds have not touched them as of yet.","1444":"The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This \"Chili Chipotle Powder\" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.  The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!  Stick with a plain old generic \"chili powder\" instead of this.","1445":"I tried to use these dried morels as a substitute for fresh morels in a chicken dish and they were lacking in flavor. Morels should perfume a dish and these mushrooms did nothing when rehydrated.","1446":"Very disappointed in these nuts.  Horrible taste.  I got my money back and these went into the garbage.  Will not trust Azar again.  Same thing with the raw cashew pieces.  I thought they tasted toxic.","1447":"Worst tasting macadamia nuts ever because they arrived rancid. You feel sick after eating a few. This should not get even one star, it is rancid, meaning it is poison. Can't believe Amazon would sell rancid food and then not allow a way for it to be returned for refund. I will be thinking twice before I order any other food item through Amazon. I don't trust Amazon as much any more.","1448":"I concur 100% with the other negative reviews.  My nuts arrived rancid and were not edible.  What more is there to say other than these Azar macadamia nuts were a huge waste of good money?  Two pounds of expensive nuts were tossed out in the back yard to feed the wild life and even the squirrels would not eat them.  I will stick with organic raw macadamias, preferably from Hawaii and a more reliable producer.","1449":"$59.99 for 6 boxes of 17.7 oz each ($10.00 \/ Item), plus $14 shipping? They have them in stores for about $5 - $6.","1450":"Puzzled as to why this product doesn't live up to the claims? You're not the only one. There does not appear to be any evidence at all to support the claims made. One has to wonder if the testimonials are indeed genuine, given the lack of evidence.","1451":"These Sweetleaf \"flavored\" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution.","1452":"I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider \"too salty\" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland - not peanut-y.  Trader Joe's \"blister peanuts\" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial brand like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store. Sorry I got them.","1453":"I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!   Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.","1454":"I will never know how this product is. Amazon\/Starbucks chose to send this order with the requirement I sign for it!  Why they would do this on a $20.00 order is beyond me.  I work and am not home to sign for packages.  The package was returned and Amazon\/Starbucks has yet to reply to my emails or even return my money. This in my first Amazon disappointment and I have ben a customer for nearly 10 years.","1455":"These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag.","1456":"I love cherries ripe, jammed, dried, any way I can get them.  I've eaten lot of different kinds of dried fruit from different providers. These were stale and I ended up throwing them out.","1457":"Very disappointed with the taste of this product;it really lacks flavor.In the future i will wait until Schluckwerder Marzipan is back in stock.","1458":"I do not love that they arrived in many small broken pieces. Rather difficult to spread something on crumbs, wouldn't you say?  Might I suggest that this item is marked FRAGILE in the future?  I was well pleased when DH found these on line as it's a constant search trying to find this particular cracker and seemed a more logical answer than going from one grocery to another in attempts to locate them.  However, all these broken crackers will have me out looking again before the weekend and I ordered 2 boxes\/cases.","1459":"After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs.  Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs.  My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers.  I guess we won't be ordering them this way again.  We are both very disappointed.","1460":"I ordered a case of each. The tomatoe chili are the worst sardines I've ever tried. The title should read sardines in tomatoe and sugar, as sugar is placed in the ingrediants before salt or chili powder. Besides the sauce the fish did not seem to have good flavor either. The case in smoked oil were quite good, good taste and the fish were medium sized with good flavor and texture. I would rate them 4 or 5 stars but the tomatoe chili deserve no stars or negative stars.","1461":"I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found--it's all artificial flavoring. I had to throw the bag away.","1462":"The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.  Overall the taste wasn't what I expected - it was kinda yucky\/pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not \"terrible\" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.  I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit.","1463":"Be cautioned, do not order these in the summer.  No protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat, so I received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo!  The entire bag was liquid when I received it.","1464":"Bought this candy to try it as a fill in snack. Not a fan of gummi stuff. So, that was my mistake. But, the strawberry flavor is ok. The bag is gigantic. So it's good if you have a lot of kids to eat them. They advertise a five pound bag, they're not kidding.","1465":"Not tasty... and almost impossible to chew at all! Items are pretty, but seriously, have no taste and are like chewing rubber.","1466":"After reading other reviews, I was looking forward to trying the Haribo strawberry gummi candy.  I was very disappointed with this candy.  Although these candies are shaped like strawberries, their flavor and scent do not resemble strawberries at all. In addition, the gummi candies lack sweetness.  After sampling several of the strawberries, I am going to throw away the remainder of the bag.  Disgusting!  Try the Haribo gummi peaches.  Those candies are wonderful.","1467":"I have purchased these gummi candies in the past and not had a problem, but these strawberries tasted terrible and I ended throwing them out.","1468":"We bought these for our two dogs: a 65 pound, year and a half old lab mix and a six year old, 80 pound shephard\/lab mix.  One of the bones splintered and broke in the first hour of them chewing it.  I removed it immediatly and have requested a refund from Amazon for the product. Be careful with these and watch your dogs.  It is a sizable piece that broke and really could have caused some damage if swallowed.","1469":"Some of the cookies were crumbled.  I also found out that these cookies routinely sell for $2.50 each at walgreens.  Paying more that $4 per for some crubled cookie did not go well.  I will not be purchasing this items again.","1470":"My wife loves these biscuits so I thought I would surprise her and buy a Family Pack of 5. They arrived packed in a box with the other items I purchased which included a heavy can of syrup and a can of pectin, neither of which were fully secured inside the box. Although they tasted as good as usual, my wife was very disappointed since so many of the biscuits were broken, probably around 20%. I doubt whether we will buy these on-line again.","1471":"While these cookies are very tasty, I would have liked that all the cookies in the package were whole. we have opened 4 out of the 5 packs each pack had almost half the cookies crumbled or broken. I found out about these cookies while on a Delta flight. The two pack in which I was given were not damaged I was given 4 packs in all and all of them were fine. The ship box could have been a little larger and better padded.","1472":"All of the items listed on the description were not included in the box.  I was missing at least 4 food items.","1473":"First off let me say I am a foodie. The 2 \"energy\" bars tasted terrible. Of course the other 3 ice cream products are delicious. But for almost $17.00 it is not worth it. Oh and the magnet is just a advertisement and didn't stick to the fridge.","1474":"I ordered this because the title says ice cream and food sticks...I received all ice cream. I don't have time to mess with a return. Change the title if it's assorted ice cream.","1475":"I usually drink French Roast, either Peet's or the Costco variety. This coffee had a distinctive burnt taste, much more pronounced than Peet's. It is drikable, but certainly not in the same league. Will not return, but will only use in latte's, where the taste is mitigated by the milk","1476":"These seeds would not sprout.  I had to return them since I bought them to sprout.  This was a hassle since I had to try to sprout them 2 times to assure it was the seeds and not my mistake.","1477":"My husband and I tried this coffee in place of our favorite Dunkin Donuts one day and we had to throw out the pot. It was too bitter to drink! We definitely do not recommend this coffee.","1478":"When I bought this I was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor.  Its not close.  I suppose if you can't eat peanuts this might be an alternative but I would look at other nut butters.","1479":"Neither of our cats was the least bit impressed with this product. The flakes did arrive as scheduled, but remain unused except for small amounts that were presented to the cats in various ways in hopes that they would find the flakes appealing. No joy.","1480":"I tried it, but I just didn't like it.  Not a good tasting sugar substitute in my opinion.  I'd rather do without sugar than use this again.","1481":"Ideal  Based on my experience with iced tea and coffee , Ideal is about as sweet as \u00bd or 1\/3 of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000FMIMNK\">Sweet 'N Low Zero Calorie Sweetner - 1500 Packets<\/a>. Quite frankly I'm disappointed that this doesn't work as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0025UAL0M\">Sweet 'N Low, Zero Calorie Sweetener, 0.035-Ounce Packets (Pack of 2000)<\/a>.  I can't recommend this.  Gunner April, 2012","1482":"I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again.","1483":"These crackers are great.  Unfortunately, every box I've bought is about 50% broken.  And that's from several different stores.","1484":"keebler townhouse olive oil crackers taste OK but are a waste of money when 80% of minicrackers are broken into 1\" pieces","1485":"Why the heck can't Townhouse just get crackers right for once? Remember that feeling of dread you got when you slept over a friend's house and they had brands\/foods not part of your world? That's the feeling that these crackers arise. A little too crunchy, a little too \"fried\", a little too much olive oil\/spice imbibed (yes, despite the olive oil and sea salt proclamation on the box, there is garlic and onion present). Hey, you see these at your next sleepover, make up a rambling excuse referencing obscure food allergies, and flee.","1486":"These plastic eggs are terrible quality.  I bought them to use as centers for my classroom.  I don't expect they will last much wear and tear with students because the plastic is thin, the hinges are weak, and there are even holes in some of the eggs.  I would NOT buy this product again.  I would DEFINITELY not buy these eggs for Easter to put inside it--the eggs feel dirty and filmy and it would creep me out to put candy inside them.  There's a reason these are some of the most inexpensive--the quality is sub-par and disappointing.","1487":"I was so disappointed in this coffee. I guess I was fooled by the \"Oooh it's more expensive than the others, there must be something special to it! I have to try it once!\"I never get taken in by price!! There was absolutely nothing to it that was any better than other K cups from other brands that sell Colombian coffee. Don't waste your money on it, not worth it...","1488":"This was just not my cup of tea - er, I mean coffee (har har). It had a sharp, acrid taste to it, and left a bitter aftertaste. I'm not a coffee connosisseur by any means, but I know what I like and I know what I don't like, and I don't like this. I would not recommend it, especially with so many other Keurig coffee options.","1489":"This coffee was substituted for a coffee I had ordered in a coffee club. It was $4.00 more than what I usually get and like. It was bitter(harsh) and strong. I thought it was terrible. Quit the coffee club and would not order this again.","1490":"This Barista Prima Italian roast is suppose to be full bodied with a sweet edge.  It is not.  It is Medium-Bold (not extra bold), and has a bitter taste and a distinct aftertaste.  Milk & sugar help, but the bitter and aftertaste are still there.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001ELL512\">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)<\/a> is a much better choice if you want a good Italian blend.  Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers.","1491":"Got this k-cup in a selection that came with my new Keurig. I usually make the small, 6 oz. cup. The resulting brew was so bitter and acrid that is was undrinkable... not just bad. Thinking that I must have done something wrong I tried again.....this time making a 12 ouncer......absolutely no difference. It tasted distinctly burnt! I was very disappointed as I like strong coffee and, usually, Italian style roast is my favorite. I would give this one a pass.......","1492":"The labeling on this product is deceptive, I recently purchased this item in the store thinking when it says Pennsylvania Dutch and Americas Favorite Mushroom I was buying food produced in the US only to get it home and find it was a product of China.  How sad that a company would try to do this.","1493":"After following the directions to the t I was completely unable to stomach this product.  It was a little crunchy and very jelly-like.  This was just a huge waste of money for me and very disappointing because I was really excited to think I had found such a low calorie substitute for regular pasta.","1494":"These look like noodles, but after that there is no comparing this product to pasta.  The texture is rubbery and there is no flavor.  If you love pasta, you will not love this product.","1495":"Blah!  My baby didn't like it, then I tasted it and it was awful.  It is NOTHING like what you might expect.  It's like bland goop with a faint hint of unseasoned over-boiled chicken.  What, is the theory that we should give our babies nasty food simply to take advantage of the fact that they have nothing to compare it to?  I didn't even feed it to my dog.","1496":"My girls hated it.  They gagged as soon as they smelled it....and so did I!  So gross!!  Like dog food but worse.","1497":"I have already communicated with the See's company about my disappointment in the item they sell as truffles.  My definition of Truffles and See's are not the same.  The candy they sent was delicious and I ate it all, but it was not what I expected i.e. round chocolates filled with various flavors of chocolate ganache.  The item See's sells as truffles was a box of assorted soft centered chocolates of various shapes.  I may buy other candy from See's in the future, but certainly not truffles.","1498":"See's makes delicious chocolates; close to the best; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. I think that every one should boycott See's for that reason.","1499":"I have been giving my senior dog these pill pockets for about two years now.  Up until recently they've been great.  However, they seem to have changed the formula and now she hates them.  I have to shove them down her throat and often get bit in the process.  Because I have to give her so many pills a day, I buy them in bulk and now have a closet full of these losers in every flavor. So disappointing.","1500":"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.","1501":"The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.","1502":"This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.","1503":"we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.","1504":"Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was $3-4 less at Target.","1505":"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).","1506":"The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.","1507":"While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.","1508":"Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.","1509":"not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products","1510":"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.","1511":"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.","1512":"These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.","1513":"I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.","1514":"The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.","1515":"The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.","1516":"Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!","1517":"The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.","1518":"I thought this was a great buy, but as noted by Scott D., the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content \"Sugar in the Raw\".  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess I'll watch for the next crop.","1519":"howdy y'all,  the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.  as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.  take care, lee","1520":"Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a \"baby-mouth\" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)  For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.","1521":"I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others.","1522":"I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable.","1523":"I was amazed at how quickly it arrived!  It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal.  You get what you pay for.","1524":"Toy was typical quality I expected.  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping!","1525":"This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.","1526":"The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts.","1527":"The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic.","1528":"I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product.","1529":"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste.","1530":"This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.","1531":"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome.","1532":"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness.","1533":"These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin.","1534":"The first time I tried these, I thought, \"WOW!\" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige.","1535":"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.","1536":"These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.","1537":"I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!","1538":"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a \"low salt\" item.  They seem as salty as any \"regular\" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.","1539":"Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.","1540":"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again.","1541":"Expiration date 1-13. Smashed and. stale. edible, not real enjoyable for the price I paid, One of the best pretzel's I had when i purchased them from Publix. They stopped carrying them, I must find another addiction.","1542":"Bought this at a local specialty-item store because I adore chutney.  Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.  It is mostly gel (jelly) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches...I've had much better and that's just talking about the supermarket brands.  Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality.","1543":"I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken. I couldn't send it back as i needed for a project.","1544":"Of course, we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is!!!! Unfortunately, after I purchased two of these gift bags online, I found them in a local store for half the price. Lesson learned???!!!","1545":"Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates??? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2.98 a bag..wow","1546":"It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. There's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though.","1547":"Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time.","1548":"The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway.","1549":"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste.","1550":"The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan.","1551":"They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He won't eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.   We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I don't know.   We DO like Enjoy Life's other products.   They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates.","1552":"Would be a quality product if it weren't so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be.","1553":"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick.","1554":"I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite.","1555":"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help.","1556":"I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be. $13.95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around $1.09. Now as far as the item itself, this brand of Panang Paste is excellent. The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant. I would recommend the paste but not the price.","1557":"These little animal crackers taste good & my doggies like them, but I won't be buying again. They are like the human animal crackers & have flour & sugar & other bad stuff for dogs. I will continue to buy the healthy treats for my doggies which they also love without sugar. You might want to try Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Natural Balance, Zukes, just to name a few.","1558":"i bought the liter size bottles of this dressing on Amazon, so i am assuming they are the same since they have the same name and the nutritional facts are identical. This dressing is definitely too sweet for my taste. My wife agrees. Otherwise very good. I use it on tossed salads only.","1559":"I was expecting to receive only Starburst. When I received this it was half Skittles which I did not want or need.  I needed only Starburst.  Next time I will just go to the store.","1560":"It's a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes, but this was 3x the cost of granulated raw sugar","1561":"This does not reflect on the product but my shi-tzus took them and left them laying on the carpet. Normally with chicken or turkey snacks, they go nuts.I donated both containers to the Humane Society. I'd try a smaller quantity for a first order.","1562":"4 bags of chips were open when I received the shipment. I am hoping that the chips were blew open during shipment in flight.  No more chips for me through Amazon.  Otherwise, the chips are good to eat and very salty.","1563":"The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip.","1564":"This tea is a new flavor of black tea by Tazo. It's better than some other brands but not even close to beIng as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus (which they took off the market). I don't think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores.","1565":"Cans are lined w\/ material that contains BPA which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of time.  12-5-10  I didn't see the liner when I opened a different can from the same case.  I'm scratching my head.","1566":"I ordered 48 lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it. So I rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from Michaels. Also a few were cracked or broken, so luckily I ordered more than enough. Unwrapped they are so adorable!","1567":"These are tiny packets. I bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not. My kids love the product, but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages. I sent them back.","1568":"These are actually pretty good little potato puffs, and best of all - no CHEESE!  (unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).  Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10.","1569":"These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an \"off\" batch.","1570":"Omaha Steaks 8 (5.75 oz.) Stuffed Baked Potatoes  ''' The Stuffed Baked Potatoes were unimpressive and lacking in flavor.  I tasted no bacon or chives.  However, they do make an attractive addition to a meal.","1571":"Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)","1572":"a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I don't buy from any supplier that ships by price. This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar.","1573":"I bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that I have had with canned crab. I was hoping that this product was different than  previous canned crab that I have had. Alas, it is just a little better. Unfortunately, canned crab just seems to be not very good and I have  to stick with fresh expensive crab.","1574":"Maybe these a better when they're very fresh.  You could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these.  They taste great.","1575":"I sent this product to my brother in law, so I have never seen the product and know nothing about it.  All I heard from him was that he was not impressed.  Other than that, I can say that it was delivered.  I ordered two of these going to different addresses and we got immediate feedback on the first one, but until we spoke to my brother in law, we had no idea if the product had even been shipped.  Would I order again?  Probably not...  Thanks anyway, Curt U","1576":"Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w\/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*","1577":"This stuff isn't bad at all. But you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything? This roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes, morning eggs or a caesar salad. All in all, for the price, it's pretty good,","1578":"I use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes, and this brand is as good as any I've found, though the red coloring is perhaps a little much!","1579":"Not bad, but like others say a bit too salty. I do notice a strange after taste, tho. I like Boyardee's better. And won't buy this again.","1580":"I like the concept, and I like Asian food, but the \"roasted peanut noodle\" variety of this McDougall's entree doesn't have enough peanut flavor for me.  Sauce is rather thin, too, and the flavor's fine--just not sure I could identify it as peanut.  I'll try a different variety next time, I think.","1581":"Tastes great. Price is okay. Received in timely manner, but two of the soup packages were bent. Hope the price comes down.","1582":"first time I've tried this item, it's just ok, the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me","1583":"My sister and I did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it, and we couldn't tell the difference between these and the two other brands I had on hand. I wouldn't buy them again.","1584":"I am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies, they are crunchy and flavorful and have NOTHING added.  The tomato fragments are extremely dry and tough, more like old sun dried, and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes.  I do appreciate that these are organic!","1585":"It is a good tasting product.It does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still can't eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal.","1586":"It's like eating a large box of paste.  I enjoy the flavor but I usually cook them and then mix with something else I'm eating as it's a no-go straight out of the box!","1587":"Overall, this was good, but not great.  The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star.  I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste.  I'd buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more.  I may try that egg tip!","1588":"I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions.","1589":"A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten-free.  Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says \"gluten-free\" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat\/gluten.","1590":"I don't plan on reordering it, but it was definitely edible and filling since I added chicken.","1591":"These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible.","1592":"Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar.","1593":"Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S\/P ones are NASTY!","1594":"I order these chips on a regular basis.  If you are doing Weight Watchers, these chips are 2 points a bag.  When this particular shipment arrived at my house, it was poorly packaged.  I received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  This is the 1st time in the four times that I've ordered these, hopefully it won't happen again.","1595":"I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!!","1596":"I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure I'll get them again.","1597":"Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat \"regular\" ones. Won't buy again.","1598":"Although they are mildly healthier, they don't taste as good as Baked Lays.  Also, having a huge box of chips around isn't necessarily healthy because I ended up eating them more often.  They are worth a try, but they just seem a bit overpriced (even with subscription savings) and over-hyped.","1599":"I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.","1600":"Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco. An 18 pack is only $7.89 at Costco.","1601":"So for a \"healthier\" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.  The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt.","1602":"I have not ordered yet, my question is, from the description, it is 24 bags at 0.8 ounces. How does this equal 192 ounces in total weight?","1603":"The flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper? Tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar, thee two varieties just make one go yummm EWWWWWW tossed out those verities but the others were very good. Less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor. Still a good item but I wouldn't suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with.","1604":"I'm not as crazed about these as everyone else, but for a low-calorie snack, they're fine.  They certainly don't do much to curb the appetite though. I'm typically just as hungry after finishing as before - not like with Protein Chips (also available through Amazon).","1605":"The texture is like rice crackers, which I personally don't like. Taste isn't too bad, but every single bags are too salty, even the original flavor. I'd give four stars if they make low sodium chips. The salt.. is one of your worst enemies. I bet it does more harms to your body than MSG's.","1606":"This seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips. Small, single serving bags.  I really like the plain, unflavored Popchips, but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste.  I plan to set up Subscribe & Save for just the plain.","1607":"I actually purchased these. I myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring. From the reviews I thought they was more like munchos. They are not. BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips-","1608":"I like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that I can munch on with my lunch. I love the flavors and the packaging is perfect. Worth the buy!  The price is right, the flavors are just what they want, portion size is good thus it's a win, win situation for me and them.","1609":"Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)  Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.  Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low salt  I will not be buying these again.","1610":"Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste.","1611":"I bought this as a gift for my mother. She likes it but says it is hard to open. When she unwrapped it I remember having to help her figure out how to open it. It took me a minute. If you have arthritis you won't be able to pry this open!","1612":"I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue","1613":"This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie's then you don't have to taste the slime.","1614":"What are the white flecks floating in my recently ordered bottles of Dirty Martini Olive Juice?","1615":"I have never had sea salt before but the 95% sodium free got to me.  It has to be an acquired taste because I don't really like it --- perhaps if I used it regularly I would not want to go back --- and, perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well...","1616":"The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.","1617":"I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped banana's or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast.","1618":"The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily. The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors. I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.","1619":"When I read the reviews from other customers, I was excited about ordering and trying this mix. This morning we made waffles with both Stonewall Kitchen mix and Bisquick. The waffles from Stonewall were ok- and so were the waffles from Bisquick. The waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same.  The agreement was that Stonewall Kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost. Furthermore, it is not available in our local super market whereas Bisquick is stocked. This will be a one time purchase for us.","1620":"Every week I make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter. Their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those I make with Jiffy mix. As Jiffy mix costs a lot less, I will not likely order this product again.","1621":"This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I won't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. I'm just as happy using a Krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.  Edited for grammar's sake.","1622":"I bought the mix at the same time as the Oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  My problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  It simply smells too good.  I am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it.","1623":"We definately got a nice assortment of K-Cups but were really looking forward to trying the Peach tea which was not included in our shipment. I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog, French Toast, and a third winter type flavor. Slightly misleading from what is pictured.","1624":"The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.  It's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk.","1625":"i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks. haven't tried the veggie ones yet. the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me. just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar. tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch. i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk. taste better!","1626":"I first tried these in a bundle of other gluten-free products, and it was so fresh. So I decided to buy it in bulk, and the expiration date was only three months. I ended up given most of it away because I didn't have time to eat all of the 12 packages I received. The taste is ok, not too sweet, but I found myself getting sick of it fast.","1627":"I really wanted my kids to love it: these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious... or so it seemed. Unfortunately, none of the kids cared for it -- it tastes like stage 1 baby food (very bland) and is very runny too, so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it.","1628":"I've been feeding this wet food to my dogs for 3 years, and as my husband has said \"if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food.\" But i am a little upset with the fact that the cans aren't full. In this last case some were even only half full. I have 4 dogs and this stuff isn't cheap.","1629":"Received Different than pictured. Labels Just say \"certified\" not \"D.O.P. CERTIFIED\". Don't know if that is the same and after a couple of orders I am not going to put the effort in to find out. Also came with Basil. I want tomatoes only. Not Basil. A couple cans dented like others have said. My case was $44 now its $60. I'm over the tomato thing. I'll buy what I want in the store.","1630":"Traditional English Muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat.  This little challenger should be called something else all together.  Closer to what I would say a croissant is, having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it.  Terrific if that's what you are looking for in an English muffin but not what I'm looking for.  I would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert.","1631":"I really like the frozen Corn Muffin Tops, but the mix resulted in a dryer product. I used the paper muffin liners and I think these might have added to the dryness.","1632":"The tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value. But what you're not told is that the bags are the large size, better made for large pots and not single cups.","1633":"I love these cookies, but this paticular batch was stale, very hard, & I had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily.","1634":"They taste nice, but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues (because of the chicory root fiber). It also made me bloated.","1635":"Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.  I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee.","1636":"This coffee is inoffensive, but not strong enough for my tastes.  I do use cream, and I'm sure that makes a difference.","1637":"This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. It's a decent, smooth coffee, but I didn't think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced!","1638":"This coffee is very full bodied, and has a great aroma; however, it is the only K-Cup coffee I've had that has a bitter aftertaste. I would still drink it if someone offered me a cup, but I won't buy it again.","1639":"I didn't expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty, even if it does replace electrolytes, so that was off-putting.  It's not really bad, especially over ice, but I won't be ordering any more of it.","1640":"This is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand.  The container is smaller, there is no straw, and I like the taste of the plain one better.  It is OK.","1641":"I wanted to try this juice as I'm a big fan of coconut flavoured products.  Given that it claims to have a \"splash of pineapple\", I was expecting a light pina-colada flavour.  On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and I'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because I've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, I'd say this was nothing like what I expected.  It's not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasn't my favourite drink in terms of taste.","1642":"It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, but most light roasts don't.  It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better.","1643":"The active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid.  It is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves, but not the flowers I learned recently online.  I have been using this stuff for years and obseved this, but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules.  Unless you SPRAY the flowers with another product containing the insecticide, the Japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone.  see link [...]","1644":"For canned soup, it hits the spot decently.  There's definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it.  However, the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side.  If I was served this in a restaraunt I think I'd walk out.","1645":"I advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you. The tomally functions as the lobster's liver and pancreas. However, even in the cold Scottish waters, dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public. I was disappointed to discover this information, so I only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors.","1646":"It was my mistake - I thought there were 6 bags rather than 4. So the price per bag is much higher than what I pay at the local grocery for the same product.","1647":"not real crazy but this product. They did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties I made for the baby shower tables.","1648":"I thought it was okay but not Harbanero BBQ sauce from Hell.I would probally not get it again.Also it was not worth the money I thought it was kind of a ripoff it was 10$ for barbque sauce you could have made at home.","1649":"This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree.","1650":"This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.","1651":"The gourmet corn is smaller kernels than I like so would probably not buy it again.  But with their special oil and the Stir Crazy Popper every kernel pops every time.  I will probably return to good old Jolly Time.","1652":"I was disappointed.  I thought being Amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional.  But it's just popcorn, no better than others I've purchased.  So, so. I would not buy it again.","1653":"Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the product's performance in hot air poppers.  The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.  Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn.","1654":"If you like your popped corn small this is for you. Taste is good and it is crisp yet tender. The only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull.","1655":"Received the \"Baby Yellow\" instead of the correct \"Baby White\" kernels. Unable to return the product since it's a grocery item, but Amazon.com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund. As far as can tell, no other issues with product.","1656":"This is good popcorn, but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would.","1657":"I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.","1658":"We had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average.  Warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and\/or butter to blend in with the soup mix. We found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional, even with as little as 1\/2 cup of added whole milk.  The package of six cans contained three dented cans.  Two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed.  For this reason, we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail.","1659":"I was really excited to try clam chowder from Maine but it did not wow me.  I think Campbell's might even be better....","1660":"Our dog loves this stuff. I bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food, I thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then. But this stuff stinks really bad like dirt, it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house. If they could improve the smell of it, that would be awesome, because our dog just loves it but we can't bare the smell of it.","1661":"With the Prime shipping, this made a great last minute gift. It seems a little pricey for the amount of fish, but the quality was good (according to the person I gave it to). In the end, I think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar.","1662":"I think pack of 4 for $25.00 is too much ($6.25 per box). I got them in Target for less than $3.00 sometimes. Also, maybe because of promotion, I got them for $2.80 or around that at Safeway. I will not buy this one online. TASTE is FIVE STARS, but price is ONE STAR.","1663":"I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it's changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW that's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I won't miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers.","1664":"With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.  It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of \"100 calorie\" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.","1665":"I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.","1666":"This food is working well for my 19 1\/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info.","1667":"I ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix.  It is a heavy cake and is brown. That said, it comes in handy to make streusel coffee cake, upside down cake and other augmented recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the heaviness isn't a problem.  Plain cake though was disappointing.  So get creative instead.","1668":"This tastes just like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. It's a hard, sweet, crunchy ring, with a minty flavor. That pretty much describes it. It's a crunchy mint shaped like a ring.","1669":"These brownies bake up very nicely.  I would call their consistency \"cake like\".  However my husband called them Healthy Brownies.  He said he could taste the flax seed.  I tend to agree.  In my opinion, if I'm going to eat chocolate, I don't want it to have that \"healthy\" taste.  On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes.","1670":"I like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy.  It is also very oily even after you cook it.  If you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product.  Also, they are not very chocolately so I added chocolate chips to the recepie.  It makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way.","1671":"I was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies.  It's OK, but not what I would serve to company.  I substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem.  Of course, I wound up eating them all anyway.","1672":"I like the dried peas from Just tomatoes and I also like their Just Corn.  They are way too expensive though.  They are really handy because I don't use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.  I will probably have to do without as I can't afford these, too bad.","1673":"If you don't want to give up the taste of coffee but can't handle the acid try this coffee. Does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects.","1674":"I love, love, love dark roasted coffee and don't like a acid taste so I thought this would be great,  I was pleased with the 'no acid taste,\" but...I had to use twice as much to get the same flavor I usually like. That wouldn't be a big deal- but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.  This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over.","1675":"I was a little disappointed...I first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf - ok.  Next I will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven.  I do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread.  Convenient is a plus.","1676":"howdy y'all,  this bread is pretty good. the potato flavor is there, recognizable as potato bread [if you've had it before] and not overwhelming. makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an enjoyably different pseudo-bruschetta base.  made it with vegetable oil and olive oil. as usual, the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor.  rated a THREE cuz it's just exactly as expected - average with no surprises.  take care, lee","1677":"I am a bit disappointed.  The flavor was not what I wanted or expected.","1678":"As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinder's White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring.  It is a great product for easy convenience.","1679":"the clams we're ok overall, quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice. also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces. product is good though.","1680":"Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them.","1681":"Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-)","1682":"It's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, can't quite figure it out.","1683":"I was expecting something more... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee. But this stuff? Everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like Nestle's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water. Watery, sugary, and nothing special.","1684":"I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.  The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.","1685":"My kids like this cocoa, but I find flavor less delicious than the more expensive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003VQXYMQ\">Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)<\/a>.","1686":"My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say. You're better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but it's too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors.","1687":"The product is not bad, but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor.  Definitely an aftertaste. Watery.","1688":"This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.  Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.","1689":"Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.","1690":"Good flavors in this combo. Not really strong but I will just set the machine on less water next time.","1691":"I like it ok, but it isn't anything great. I have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost. I'll go back to that method and save my $$ for coffee.","1692":"The flavor of this cocoa is good, but I found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water. The second cup was better when I used less water.","1693":"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time.","1694":"just got a new keurig and was looking for a great chocklate drink\/still looking\/this is fair at best\/watery and nothing to brag about","1695":"This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. It's not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I can't find better.","1696":"Just tried this for the first time today.  They are \"ok\", but they do have an odd aftertaste.  Not sure I'll be ordering these again.  Also -- the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle (without a k-cup) after making them (I assume to clean the machine out).","1697":"I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.","1698":"I didn't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup, but here's a tip: put on 8oz setting, then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk. It tastes amazingly good!  Of course if you add a little Baileys Irish Cream, it tastes even better.","1699":"This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.","1700":"Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldn't stand how sweet it was.  To each his\/her own, I guess.  But, now that I'VE had a second cup, I tend to agree -- very sweet.","1701":"I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50\/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1\/cup.  Overall they are ok\/good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area.","1702":"It wasn't a bad purchase at just $9.99 through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon and shipped for free, but took 2 stars off because it wasn't a freshness issue but Cracker Jacks\u00ae just don't taste the same like when I was a kid back in the 1980's.","1703":"Product was older then I would purchase if I knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase. It gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated.","1704":"I purchased cases of these for our company picnic. The boxes were cute, the idea of it all was a big hit. But the \"gift inside\" was a bust. I would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the \"writings on paper,\" or whatever they were. What is Cracker Jack without the gift inside? I find it to be misleading that they call it \"Original.\"  Original had the gift inside.","1705":"I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product.","1706":"These arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  However, flavor-wise our family is in agreement that Jelly Belly produces a richer plum flavor, slightly larger sugar plum in size, and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums.  The price on the Albanese sugar plums is reasonable, the flavor is good and it's always nice to support a small, independent candymaker!","1707":"PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION AND SELL ITEMS LIKE THIS CORN THERE! ALL BUT ONE CAN OF THIS GREAT TASTING CORN WAS DENTED, SEVERELY! DONT GET ME WRONG, I WILL STILL BUY DENTED GOODS, BUT ONLY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. THE DAMAGE DID NOT OCCUR IN TRANSIT EITHER WHICH DISTURBS ME. IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE SELLING DENTED CANS, FINE, BUT START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION!!!!!!","1708":"The fresh tasting Libby's Organic Corn, no additives! I can't believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! But for taste and value, this can't be beat.","1709":"This was a very good price for bulk ordering. However my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for 8th graders. There was never intent to resell these. Due to ordering limitations, I was unable to order all 300 packs from here.","1710":"I was shocked to see that the bulk version of these Jelly Belly's are just in a cardboard box, no plastic, no nothing. Doesn't seem overly hygienic. Since I didn't open the box for a few months the Jelly Belly's were getting softer and crystallizing [unbeknownst to me] because we live in a wet climate. Hmmm...just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded","1711":"I paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister, and it turns out it arrived more than a day late. That's unacceptable to me.","1712":"I love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option doesn't ship at correct times. I just received two shipments at once (even packaged in the same box) this week, when one of those shipments was supposed to be for April and I was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card.","1713":"This item didn't have the pleasant taste that most of Hodgson Mills products have, such as the Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix.  However, I found it greatly improved the flavor & added nutrition if I grated an apple into the mix. It increased the much needed moisture, & it was certainly a nutritious breakfast.","1714":"I'm dieting, and I use these as a \"treat\" to myself, when I'm craving chocolate.  I usually brew one of these & one of my coffee K-cups (either plain or hazelnut).  For 60 calories, it's not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you're on a \"calorie-budget!\"","1715":"This product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing. Watery texture was a disappointment.","1716":"I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.","1717":"These are very large bottles. It is a good dipping sauce with a sweet\/spicy flavor.","1718":"Panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best. It does not have enough chew and I find it a bit dry.   I much prefer RJ's with it's big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying, just right chew without being gummy.","1719":"I've found a new licorice,,this one is ok.,But I really don't need the extra sodium in my body....","1720":"The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.","1721":"Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price.","1722":"Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets!","1723":"A decent, clean, and simple cup of morning decaf. I find pre-wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor.","1724":"Parisian Cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand.","1725":"If you're used to Dave's Insanity sauce, or like me you're used to Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce, you're going to be really disappointed. 5 of the 6 sauces aren't spicy at all. They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings.","1726":"I am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just OK.  Nothing special...  The insanity hot sauce was fun to try though.  I probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive.","1727":"This roasted green tea was only \"so-so\" to my taste. I've found others I like better since I purchased this. However, it arrived in a box of TWELVE boxes (each with 16 or so tea bags). Way too much! Then I found that we can't return food items, so I now have a LOT of tea.","1728":"...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze-dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, I'd be more apt to open up a 69-cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with.","1729":"The tea was a lot milder in flavor than I was expecting, but still pleasant. The aroma was light. I probably would not buy this again, but that's only because I would like a more intense flavor.","1730":"Watch out for this because I wanted what was pictures however I got different colored flowers.  They use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock.  The flowers still looked beautiful, but I was expecting the white and pink flowers.  My wife got orange and yellows one instead.","1731":"I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word \"oatmeal\" in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same. I decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough. [...]","1732":"Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil.  Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful.","1733":"Icicle is a pretty good preamp for the price.  Very easy setup and a cool design, but definitely was not very rigid. It's very light and made of plastic. But the one things that I didn't like was the noise. It had a fair amount of buzz along with it.  A cheap preamp for the price, but you get what you pay for.","1734":"The level from this unit was hard to adjust, and when all was said and done, it was very low.","1735":"It does record with ease and decent quality for the price. The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you can't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you don't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time.","1736":"Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, it's an OK product.","1737":"it is what is is... and it did the job that it was made for. lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion","1738":"I bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it.  The noise and feedback I received with this device was horrible - I might have a bad unit.  When I called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. (Very cool and is why I gave them 3 stars for now)  I'll see how that process goes and update my review.","1739":"Shipping: Ordered on a Sunday of Week 1.  Placed in box on a Friday of Week 2. Received it Wednesday of Week 3. Whoever's responsible for shipping (Amazon or Blue) took their sweet time to drop it in this 8\"x5\" box.  Product: Currently testing the converter with a Shure PG58. Gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording. I do believe the product is in working condition; too bad I have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly.","1740":"The first brand of GF pancake mix I attempted was Bob's Red Mill and I loved it. I went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so I tried it. It's... okay. I'm egg-free too and used mushed banana instead, so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but I made a batch of egg ones for my in-laws and they said it was a bit mushy too.  It's not horrible, but I prefer BRM brand personally.","1741":"I was disappointed when I tried this pancake mix. Before going gluten free, Bisquick was our go-to pancake mix, so I had high expectations for the gluten free mix. The texture was a little weird. Soft and dry. I prefer the Pamela pancake mix over this one.","1742":"This mix makes GREAT belgian waffles.  We tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard GF flour.  It does make seriously great waffles though, and we go GF\/DF on these.  The waffles freeze extremely well and reheat in the toaster quite nicely.","1743":"It is good. I prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch, but for store bought, it's pretty good. Much cheaper in local grocery stores. Under $5 per box at my local stores in Chicagoland area.","1744":"Rice flour, Sugar, Leavening ( baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified potato starch, salt, xanthan gum, MAY INCLUDE SOY INGREDIENTS","1745":"The only complaint I have about the product is the price and I wish it were organic as well.  Other than that it's a great, versatile mix.  I've used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler : ).","1746":"I love this mix. My favorite of any I've tried. The only reason I starred it at 3 is because this is not a deal. I can get 3 boxes at Walmart for less than 12 dollars but I have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so YMMV.","1747":"Having recently been placed on a gluten free regime, I felt I needed some quick and easy help to get me started. It works great but is way too expensive for what it is. There were just over three cups of bisquick in the box. When I read the ingredients, I realized I could quickly mix up my own quick bread flour and keep it in the fridge. I'm glad I tried this item because it taught me that I could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money.","1748":"...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice-based gluten-free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.  I will use the mix I have, but I'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. I'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this isn't a hit in my household.","1749":"The Bisquick Gluten Free was okay, but inferior to the Bob's Red Mill and Hodgson Mill products. Pancake batter, when made according to directions, was watery, resulting in flat pancakes.","1750":"Alittle bit expensive for the product I think that it should be the same price as the non gluten Bisquick, and otherwise it's good.","1751":"I have two medium-sized dogs, and these are a real bargain, but only keep them busy for about 15 minutes. Next time I will get the larger size.","1752":"I found the candy to be harder than I had expected.  It came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty--just takes more chewing to enjoy!!","1753":"While I love Bit a Honey and don't regret my purchase, I did not find them as \"fresh and soft\" as the other reviewers. They arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth. Maybe it's because I bought the bags of individually wrapped Bit a Honey's as opposed to the actual candy bars. Next time it's the bars!","1754":"Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor.","1755":"The flavor is very mild.  We tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant.  Would not purchase again.","1756":"The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How you'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you.","1757":"I thought this would be a great decaf option, but the flavor is a lot milder than expected. I use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor. A bit better than instant for late night sippers like me.","1758":"I remembered that Melitta was a very fine ground, and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker.  But after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself, the Melitta came up average at best.  Better than Maxwell House though.","1759":"If you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race, this is not the coffee for you. It is quite flavorful, so I do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee.","1760":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about???  I thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand I usually  buy.  ..and beings the store brand is much cheaper... I'll stick with it.  It isn't bad coffee but I just don't seeing it being any better..","1761":"This makes a good pot of decaf.  Nothing remarkable - we have served this to many guests to no comments.  Nobody asked us what it was, but nobody spit it out, either :-).  It is smooth and not too strong, which is our preference.  We wouldn't hesitate to buy it again, but wouldn't go out of our way either.","1762":"The coffee is good but it is nothing special. Compared to Maxwelhouse decafe this is nearly the same just slightly better. I don't feel it is worth the extra cash to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere. I did enjoy the coffee but I probably won't buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted.","1763":"First of all, when I opened my bag of Melitta decaf, it didn't have that strong, amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has.  I brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker, and while it was ok, there was nothing outstanding about the taste.  It was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee I normally drink.","1764":"I am amazed at the consistent flavor of Melitta coffees. Seriously, I sip any Melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same. Not bad coffee, always a darker roast and a deep flavor, but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package. The Riviera Sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee, perfect for an after dinner treat.","1765":"Melitta Cafe's Riviera sunset coffee isn't bad, it just sadly isn't all that great either.  It is not something I would buy again, mainly because I'll probably forget about it.","1766":"This is part of Dr. Oz's Tea Diet. Works like a charm. I have lost inches already and I have been on it for 4 days.","1767":"I ordered in order to get variety of flavored coffees, and have to admit disappointed in the selection. Several duplicates of ordinary coffees received. Also 2 of the flavors advertised which were my primary reason for ordering were not included.","1768":"I was very excited to recieve my shipment today then to be disapppointed because 2 of the flavors that I was told would be in the package were not there! I really wanted to try Creme Brulee and Raspberry Chocolate truffle!  I am looking forward to trying the others but had I know I would not receive these flavors I would not have ordered this product!  I also did not recieve the Pink Ribbon flavor!","1769":"Pkg says soy free. Ingredients (and my stomach\/bladder) say otherwise! Also, lots of fiber in this one. If you can handle fiber (and soy) this food will fill you up like crazy. If you have IBS and have trouble with fiber,or are eating a low residue diet be careful.... I'm going back to the bread. Eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the dreaded wheat...","1770":"Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor.","1771":"I've been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I don't think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST I've found so far is Cavalier brand at another website.","1772":"The set is bigger than I thought it would be.  It would take a very big cake to set up all of this.  I ended up using only the golfer and a ball.  The golfer is about 3 inches tall and the clubs are 3-4 inches long.","1773":"I've been searching for a no-corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  I'm just glad it's warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so we'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down.","1774":"I don't know why this got such good reviews but my Yorkshire really doesn't like it. He likes Iams more than this and it's cheaper.","1775":"I guess my animals (cat and dog) can't read the amous names on bag warpings, as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry.","1776":"I like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available. I switched to this when the brand I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my \"chowhound\") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up.","1777":"This solved my pups dog food allergy problems when I started purchasing it (I have a husky and a german shepherd), but several months ago the itching started again; the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed. I wrote a letter of inquiry to Newman's, with batch numbers from the bags, but have received no answer. Since then, I've purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again.","1778":"Tastes very good.  I really like the taste.  But then it is gone.  Like it was never there.  So fleeting.  Takes two pieces to really enjoy, also.  And be VERY careful not to eat it.  Seriously, it is hard not to swallow it.  Laugh all you want.  You try it and see what I mean.","1779":"I thought this would be the perfect candybar, I love hazel nuts, I love caramel, and I love chocolate.  But there is something about the chocolate filling that I don't like.   they claim a whole hazel nut in each piece, but it's probably only half.  It's an OK candy, but I will never ever buy it again. I'll stick to Snickers with almonds!","1780":"We have been experimenting with different brands of K-Cups since we purchased our Keurig last Christmas.  While this one was okay, it just is not as good Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend for an everyday staple.  We haven't tried Green Mountain Columbian yet as a closer comparison.  However, when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one, the brew is noticibly weaker than with GM Breakfast Blend.  Also, please note that we LOVE Timothy's World Italian Blend!!  It is definitely amount our favorites.","1781":"Tried Mild Only.  Amazon $28 on 02\/12\/2012  Pro Good weight price value.  Con Mushy (was hoping it would be drier & firmer like other reviews stated). No Snap to skin. So So Flavor.  HOT Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Short Shots taste good & have better texture. Also better price\/weight ratio.  Smaller peices means better portion control.","1782":"Six Hour Power does help to create a more energetic and alert state.  The affect does not last anywhere near six hours.  For me it was a couple of hours.  It is not as strong as Five Hour Power high strength, but it is not positioned as high strength either.  For the money, I would buy this again over the regular Five Hour Power product.","1783":"My husband works outside all day long. Due to the recent heatwave, his body is depleted of fluids due to sweat. My husband uses the energy shot along with ZipFizz. The ZipFizz provides the necessary potassium to keep the body going. I personally do not recommend too many energy shot drinks during the day, but they do prove beneficial to help you keep going.","1784":"The wrappers are GOOD but it would have been easier if the filling was already in them.  The fact that it wasn't meant I had to look up what goes into a wrapper and buy water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts to help me make up my own filling.  The wrappers are GOOD but more work than heating up a frozen appetizer.","1785":"barbara's yogurt bars are okay.  i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really isn't much blueberry, or for that matter, apple flavors.  on the positive side, the bar is a soft chew.  total carbs 29g.  it's an okay bar in the glut of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store.","1786":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001EO6BCC\">Royal Oak  Gourmet Virginia Raw In Shell Peanuts, 2.5 Pound Bags (Pack of 3)<\/a>  I'll appreciate your speedy deliver of my package, however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell.  This item is going into a gift basket for my Pastor because he love raw peanuts in a shell.  I don't have time to returned them for the requested product. You have always been prompt with my orders in the past and I really do appreciate.  This is the first time you sent me an incorrect product.  I'll make it work.","1787":"These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right.  However, i ordered them on 10\/29\/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12\/31\/06.  We have only eaten four boxes.  They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months?","1788":"If you love vegetable soup you should like this. Yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too. But it was not as good as I expected or hoped it would be","1789":"I enjoyed this soup.  It was flavorful with a nice blend of spices.  I will buy it again.","1790":"I started out thinking they were OK, a little more substance than the breakfast bar from Whole Foods.  But after I ordered a 12-pack (I didn't realize it was 12 boxes of 8), and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as I was flying out the door, I realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry.","1791":"First off, my cats loved the food. One of them has had issues in the past and I need to be careful with what I feed him, and this seems to work well. However, about half the cans were your normal, semisolid cat-food consistency, and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking. They ate both kinds with equal gusto so I don't think anything was wrong with it, per se, but I still found it a little concerning. I'm ordering another batch, and we'll see how that turns out.","1792":"Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I don't mush them several of my cats just eat around them. The cats & I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and it's a little cheaper, too.","1793":"Cat grass is cat grass, and I have one cat that absolutely loves it; another that couldn't care less.  It's winter now, so I couldn't find it where I buy seeds, so I went on line.  Product is okay, service was prompt.  My disappointment: could only order one two-ounce package per shipping and handling fee.  Cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks, and I would have ordered 3 or 4 packages, but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee!","1794":"It was hard to grow but once it grew my cat loved it. I haven't found any seeds that work well yet, but I am still looking. I would buy this again is=f I had better luck with growing it.","1795":"My cat love this grass. Really easy to grow, only 3 days. Im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are 500 seeds.","1796":"Just received a case of this tea.  It tastes good and a bit on the sweet side, but not overly sweet.  I would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in China though.","1797":"I enjoyed my 1st cup very much.  The aroma was heady and the flavor was pleasantly mild.  But, ultimately, it is too mild for my daily morning \"kick\". I'll be going back to my Lavazza mornings when this is gone.","1798":"Not bad, but there are better gums than this one. At the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation, but after 5 minutes is gone.","1799":"If ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years (as the popular myth states), this one is the most likely. It tastes great, sure, but in the first few bites, it falls apart, losing any cohesiveness (gummyness), and just gets swallowed. For some reason, about 1\/3 of it remains intact and becomes gum. What little remains is as the other reviewers state, but knowing that I've swallowed more than half the sticks I've chewed is not a pleasant thought.","1800":"I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earth's Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the \"Sweet Potato & Chicken\" variety, it's sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.  After getting used to the sweetness of these (try 'em - they're like jam), it's difficult for kids to adjust to \"real\" food.  From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too.","1801":"To be honest, my baby didn't really love all of these at first. He's pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn't love all of these.  But as he's gotten older, he's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here.","1802":"I did like this product until some jars I found black mold on the inner lids.  I read other reviews, but I thought it must've been a bad batch.  I was wrong.  Earth's Best used to be very good. So I canceled my next Subscribe and Save order.  Then I feedback cancel reason to Amazon.","1803":"LOVE earths best but my 8 mth old daughter only liked one of the 4 selections. i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk. walmart usually has them for .60 each","1804":"Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby. Unfortunately, two of the four varieties don't include meat. I don't think Summer Vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack, that's what the vegetable variety pack is for. Also, the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby.","1805":"3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato & Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didn't want to eat it until I tried it myself","1806":"I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products.","1807":"This is OK rice.  It cooks fairly well in my cooker, not as good as some other tho.  But the taste is really very earthy.  I don't mind that too much, but this is almost too strong tasting.","1808":"I eat basamati brown rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless. It cooked very well in my rice cooker, but did not embody that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor.  The grains are finer and have less body than what I have enjoyed in other brands...maybe personal preference.  Would not try again.","1809":"It's got the typical Jif taste, which to me is unremarkable -- it's ... just peanut butter -- however, the single serve containers are convenient and transport well. The consistency is great -- it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery\/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.  The price is right.","1810":"Good stuff, but may be a bit expensive in relation to more local products.  Love the no sugar added, but found product at local store for half the price.  Would continue to purchase if I did not have cheaper option.","1811":"The cats don't like this flavor. I would have preferred an assortment of flavors. The product itself is good. I just have finicky cats. And I am weaning them off wet food, anyway. My older cat is getting too big! Notice I didn't say fat!  ;-)","1812":"The jar is much smaller than I imagined via pictures - I thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar, but it was instead much smaller. It is spicy though! Lots of jalapeno, not a lot of honey mustard!","1813":"These Piquillos are packaged in a thin plastic package, though I thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll-top tin (like sardines are packed in).The peppers that survived the shipping were very good, lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor. However, one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs, making a huge mess.","1814":"I'm a huge fan of the McCormick brand gravy mix and I assumed that this would be as good.  It isn't.  It's not bad enough for a 2 but i'm annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the McCormick.","1815":"Tastes like darjeeling, although, like one of the previous reviewers said, it's missing some of the body of a good darjeeling. I give it 3 stars for taste alone. But for the price I paid for it, I guess it's still a solid deal  You get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea, I guess it's good. :)","1816":"First of all, these things are delicious. However, opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible. They're super crumbly, so open the package with care. I won't buy them again. There are too many other good options that are way less messy.","1817":"I don't really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios.  I'd just rather have the plain dark chocolate.  I think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today.","1818":"I'm drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but that's because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools.","1819":"I found the oil a bit weak in taste. I had expected a stronger walnut flavor. I hope it is not chemically produced like most truffle oils.","1820":"This product was okay tasting. My problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles. Really?!?","1821":"I've read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily.  Also, it has a bit of a grainy texture and I think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest.","1822":"I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan. He will suffer through half a jar, but will not finish a whole one. I guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds.  We will keep trying.  He loves, loves, loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone.","1823":"My dogs really did not care for these. were not real p-nutty.","1824":"It definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average.... I can't say I taste the \"dark chocolate decadence\".... And it's not that strong but usually I like stronger tasting coffee.","1825":"Have had this gum from other sources and always liked it. This particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before...could be it is older gum(there is no expiration date on it) or they are making it with less peppermint now. Otherwise I received this order very quickly.","1826":"This is a great price, but every time I've bought these through Amazon, the bottles frequently have dark... \"stuff\" on the threads of the bottle when you open it.  I've never seen this when buying them from the local drugstore, so I worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic?  Can't say for sure of course.  They do have the desired effect, so I'm not complaining too much.  It's kind of gross sometimes though.","1827":"I took it at 5am yesterday. It is now almost 3am the next day and I am laying in bed and skin feels tingly, can't sleep at all. I feel like I am at super sayan level 4, power of the red monkey. I could shoot ki blast out the window if I wanted too. Maybe some kame hame wave's too.","1828":"I did not expect this hot chocolate to be quite as sweet as I found it to be. It also has more calories than previous Ghiradelli similar hot chocolate. It has a rich taste and if I were not concerned with weight I would overlook the higher calories.","1829":"The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It's different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++","1830":"love the contents, but two of eight containers were badly dented.  jan","1831":"so anyways, i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier, but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright. comes in a weird form, not powder kinda like small bits of grass. Taste fine not sour or sweet","1832":"This was a christmas present for my son in law who collects super hero stuff. He was surprised but really liked it.","1833":"Been waiting for this to be shipped for over 30 days.  Might be OK - hard to tell unless they send it.","1834":"it is definatly not 4,000,000. half the heat of daves ghost sauce, maybe weaker. may be a good dipping sauce","1835":"HAs a good taste it is a lil hott not 2 bad maybe just a lil less hotter than blaires ultra death sauces but has a better flavor","1836":"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again.","1837":"This is the new \"Dublin\" dr pepper now bottled in Temple Texas.  This is produced after Dr. Pepper force Dublin out of production.  It is not the same as Dublin Dr. Pepper, that is why it is so cheap.  If you want the real thing, you'll pay more for it.","1838":"I received my 2 cases of Rice Works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price BUT in every single bag (24) the chips were crunched\/smashed into little pieces so i guess I have 24 bags of salad toppers or ..... but not chips.","1839":"I have tried all of the RICEWORKS chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un-opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chile chips. These chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from brown rice and pop when chewed on. I bought them @Top Food's here in WASHINGTON State Costco has the larger 16oz BAG in the sweet chile flavor only. Price was $2.99 at Top Foods for 5.5oz size $2.88 on Amazon for same size. Costco was $4.99 for the 16oz size...","1840":"This cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist, but bland.  Compared to the new deluxe Duncan Hines version of German Chocolate cake, this is not impressive.  It will do when you're craving something different from regular chocolate cake, though.","1841":"I bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price.  Well lets just say you get what you pay for.  The flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast.","1842":"I prefer rich, strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste","1843":"Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much. ...(cough) So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping they'd have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good! Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly-gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly\/gummy, but don't expect much.","1844":"Very crunchy and salty, just like described. I can also tell they use a lot of artificial  color. Not the best caviar. Might be really good for sushi!","1845":"I couldn't really taste the bergamot in this tea.  It had more of a slight orange peel taste.  Since it is organic, I expected a cleaner, richer taste. It's OK, but not as good as the regular Twinings Earl Grey.  I have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the Twinings, but at a much higher price.","1846":"My two cats used to love this formula, but I guess they got tired of it, or maybe the formula was changed ... I only feed it occasionally now.","1847":"The description of the item is \"small pieces, diced.\"  I would call them chopped. They're basically what you'd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake.  I like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal.  They do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo.  Mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box.","1848":"I purchased the Wood Smoked flavor.  The reviewers who said that these are too salty were right.  They tastes like sticks of salts.  If you nibble on them very slowly, then they tastes ok as the salts disolve slowly.  If you take a big bite, then it would be like biting into a chunk of salt.  I love the texture and the stringiness of this beef jerky but I would not buy it again because of the high sodium content.","1849":"This beef jerky is extremely salty. I tried the wood smoked flavor, and I figured people were just being a bit picky. However, it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much. The container says 570mg sodium or 24% of daily value for one serving. I would recommend trying a different product.","1850":"Was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure, but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough.  Flavor wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  I'm just glad they weren't that greasy.","1851":"This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure.","1852":"I absolutely loved Newman's Own pretzels with the pepper baked right into the pretzel for just a little bite. These are not as tasty and yes, they are messy and overly seasoned.  Not really a fan of this line of flavored broken pretzel pieces, although this was a little better than some of their other flavors.  Someone out there needs to try making the baked-in black pepper version again, please. Not sure why Newman's Own stopped.","1853":"The package arrived 3 days earlier then it said it would and they were very fresh. They were also cheaper then the candy. Some of the candy had melted together but it was only maybe 3 pieces per bag. Overall really good.","1854":"I have to add that I've not baked with this yet. But when I received this I was aghast at the ingredients. Perhaps I didn't read it well because the ingredient list is right there... I guess I simply expected alcohol & vanilla beans, maybe sugar, in an \"ol' timey\" product.  I'll update this once I use it.","1855":"These are sort of like brownies.  A little soft, a little dry.  My 7 year old really likes them.  They're good if you are on a restricted diet, but otherwise nothing too special.","1856":"Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc.  This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty.  However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature.  I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.  Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be?","1857":"I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.","1858":"In the past I have purchased these cookie bars through Amazon and have had good business. However, Amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars. It is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods I purchase. I am not happy with Amazon's business this time. Ingredients change often! Amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website.","1859":"I love Community Coffee but the batch I received of the Special Decaf was old the bags had lost their vacuum packed state.","1860":"THESE TREATS ARE MORE FOR A LARGER DOG AS THEY ARE VERY HARD AND THICK.  THE GIRLS (my maltese) LIKE THEM EXCEPT WAY TOO BIG AND HARD TO CHEW FOR THEM..","1861":"I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper.","1862":"I split this can with my spouse.  I would have given it 2 stars, he gave it 3.  Nice idea, 100% carbonated juice, but the taste is pretty mild.  Not really what I would call refreshing.  Good idea, though, I would try it in other flavors.","1863":"This was a weird drink - I had high expectations, but the flavor was just odd - it really did taste like fizzy Tang drink mix.  However, my kids really liked it, and I think it is a great alternative to junky soda, so I will most likely buy more - but not for ME to drink.  ;)","1864":"It may be all natural but it didn't have a natural taste to me.  The can size is small and the calories were more than I thought there should be.  I like the mild carbonation ok but I wouldn't switch from orange juice.","1865":"I had to try this Orange Tangerine flavor because I had tried the watermelon\/strawberry and didn't like it very much, but wanted to give this company another shot. I do prefer this Orange tangerine; it has a nice citrus flavor with that carbonated fizzy on the tongue sensation. I give it a 3, better then the watermelon\/strawberry and on ice I drank the whole can.","1866":"I didn't read the label before I tried the drink, so I was a little surprised by the carbonation.  It had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation.  However, I've been a long-time drinker of the Tropicana Orange-Tangerine juice and Switch is simply not as good, IMHO.  If I wasn't already a Tropicana drinker, I might be interested in the Switch version of Orange-Tangerine, but I'm not going to \"switch\".  Sorry for the pun.","1867":"On the plus side, they get the flavor and carbonation right here.  One fears a Tang taste, but it's more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that it's no Fizzy-Lifting Drink.  On the downside though, one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue.","1868":"This is a decent flavored carbonated juice.  It's 100% juice which is good for the more health conscious people.  It tastes pretty good, sweet and a little tangy.  But the flavor does fall short.  Like some reviewers have said, the drink tastes more like a punch than pure orange or tangerine juice.  Do yourself a favor, if you want orange flavored soda, then go for an orange flavored soda.  If you want tangerine, then buy tangerine.  The infusion of both flavors really causes both flavors to fall short slightly short.","1869":"I thought I would like this more than I do. Maybe it's my palate, but my first taste impression was pineapple, not orange or tangerine. The small portion size may be acceptable for an energy drink, but is not what I would call thirst-quenching. Not a good choice for anyone trying to control calories or carbs. On the plus side, it is sweet, but not too sweet and the level of carbonation is well-balanced.","1870":"I don't like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days (even the low-calorie ones) are so sweet.  This was nicely not-too-sweet, but had a canned, not fresh juice flavor.  It is personal taste, but I didn't care for the 'processed' flavor.","1871":"I'm not a big fan of carbonated juices, but am a huge lover of orange\/tangerine.  In that respect, this was a disappointment for me, not being as tangeriny enough for me.  The first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste, but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips.  But, after waiting a while for another sip, that initial unpleasantness returned.  If I'm going to drink juice, I'll stick to what I prefer, uncarbonated.","1872":"This drink is ok. A little pricier with several more calories and carbs than I would like, but it is a good alternative to soda. I am glad there's no artificial sweetener in it. It's sweet enough without it. I like the Crayons drinks better, but cannot find them anymore. I also like the flavor of the R.W. Knudsen Spritzers a little more.","1873":"I wasn't sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink, but decided to give it a try.  While it was drinkable, I actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice.  This actually tasted like an artificial soda, much like a very well known orange soda.  The carbonation was excessively strong, with too much bite and burn for my liking.  As some other reviewers pointed out, the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding.  It is almost too sweet, and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much.","1874":"I didn't mind the taste of this very much - it tasted like Minute Maid OJ mixed with soda.  My husband couldn't stand it at all.  My only issue with this was that it was a heavy-syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming.  If there was a better balance of flavor to liquid to make it a little lighter tasting, I think this would be much more refreshing and enjoyable.  Might be fine for kids though - since they like that sugary orange stuff.","1875":"<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 2:47 Mins  <\/span>Short video review with first open, pour and taste of The Switch Orange Tangerine.","1876":"If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so don't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink.","1877":"The Switch Orange\/Tangerine gets kudos from me for not including added sugars and nasty ingredients found in some traditional sodas, but as for flavor, it leaves something to be desired.  The initial yummy tangerine flavor of the drink is great, but after a few swallows, a strange after-taste invaded my mouth.  I found it difficult to drink the whole can.","1878":"My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1\/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.","1879":"This orange soda is clearly more healthful, and it tastes tangier, although somewhat less sweet, than other orange sodas.  The one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine.","1880":"I chuckled a little when I read that this soda had no added sugar when I checked the label in the can since it already has 34gms of sugar anything more added and you'll have sugar junkies of whoever tries the drink.  The soda is tasty and quite fizzy, I think it has more carbonation than Fanta which goes flat easier.  The can is the typical size of an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda.  It is flavored naturally, but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks.","1881":"According to the side of the can, it's 100% juice with a balance on the carbonation. It tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste. The low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice. I probably wouldn't buy it in the store because of the weird taste.","1882":"This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldn't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:  34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff. 36g total carbs.  Like I said, it's good but don't get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you. There's no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least.","1883":"Sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together, the result tastes like none of them.  This doesn't taste like orange or tangerine.  It tastes, to me at least, very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all, and I like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour.  Still, great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet.","1884":"The logo on the can states \"0% of what you don't want...\" but that's not quite true. It's quite tasty, but loaded with calories.  Next time, they need to leave out the sugar as well.  Also, this drink isn't readily available.","1885":"The drink is 100% juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water.  It tastes like a cross between <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001GN4OHK\">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans<\/a> and the orange drink from McDonalds.  It was refreshing at first, but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically.  It's odd, because the drink doesn't have any unnatural flavors, according to the ingredients list.  If the end flavor was more natural, I would definitely buy it again.","1886":"In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink. The degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an \"orangey\" taste to it. But I cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage. For now, I would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like \"Crush\".","1887":"Overall the drink was decent. It's tart and sweet at the same time. Switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it. I myself would prefer a Spicy V8 over this. It might be a good substitute for some who don't want to drink as much soda, but for me i'll just stick with the v8 and the occasional soda.","1888":"This product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine. It also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet. Not lingering or noticeable aftertaste.","1889":"When I first glanced at this item, my first thought was a Nehi orange-type soft drink.  However, it is made of 100% fruit juice with carbonation added.  It tastes way too sweet for my taste buds, much more than regular OJ.  In fact, it left an aftertaste in my mouth and I had to brush my teeth right after taste-testing it.  I ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation.","1890":"This soda sounded like a good idea, but it is just too sweet. The orange and tangerine juice is clear and bitter tangy but the sugar in this particular flavor is overwhelming to me. (On the other hand I liked the cherry very much.) I would drink it anyway, if it were offered, it certainly is not terrible. But I would not buy it again.","1891":"How can tang be lugubrious?  If you made it a bit watered down, a bit more aftertasty, a bit less child-friendly.  It's an all right soda, but I don't feel the thrill of drinking it that I did drinking tang as a child.  I can't pretend I'm an astronaut with this.  Sometimes, advertising just helps.","1892":"Taste like tang, only more expensive.  I'm not a fan of tang.  If you love tang and want some convenience, this just might be the drink for you.","1893":"Sadly, I was supposed to receive this product, but never did.  I imagine it's good given the others I've tried, but alas, that won't happen.  Still, I have to write a review, so there you go.","1894":"This product is tasty -- it's carbonated juice (a blend of several juices, mostly apple, grape, tangerine). But the 8.3 ounces costs $1 and contains 140 calories. This is a little rich for me, both economically and calorically. I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind spending their money and calories on juice.","1895":"Switch Orange Tangerine is ok but not what one might expect.  First of all, there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine (this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them).  Switch basically is carbonated juice.  The taste isn't a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda (which can be debated).  It is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty.","1896":"If you like your drink not so smooth and a bit \"tangy\"...this should work for you ....but... alas! ... not for  me..","1897":"I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. It's bubbly. It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead.","1898":"This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.  The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.  Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.  Not bad, but not what I want.","1899":"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either. I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice, and the can design is pleasant to look at.  The orange tangerine isn't bad; this flavor isn't as syrupy as some of Switch's others.  However, at 140 calories per can, this beverage has 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda. Too many for me.","1900":"It's not bad. Good ingredients for a change so that's a plus. Taste is okay but not great. I would drink it if offered, but doubt I'd buy it.","1901":"I was looking forward to this tea, but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea.  I prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus-based tea (aka \"herbal infusion\") and in my opinion, mint and \"tropical\" don't mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients.  Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical\/hibiscus tea.","1902":"Work well and made solidly.  For whatever reason the Keurig takes longer to complete the brewing cycle when using these cups and the liquid bleeds through the filter on the outside of the cup making a small mess.  They do the job as intended but could use a different type of filter to make the experience less messy.","1903":"work OK. main problem they leak out the top a bit as well as inside the machine.  is it worth the extra work?  it is if you want to pay a fraction of the cos of a k-cup.  plus you can use any coffee you desire.","1904":"These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee.","1905":"I like the DisposaKups.  If I'm fixing more than one cup, it's quicker to use the DisposaKups than it is to clean out the refillable holder, which came with my machine.","1906":"Product is, as advertised, a good way to utilize your own coffee blends.  It is easy to fill and prepare for use, however, it sometime leaks at the end of the brewing process.","1907":"It is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the K-cups. If it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup.","1908":"I recently purchased DisposaKups from this seller! Not only did I receive great customer service and fast shipping, but my product came packaged perfectly. I absolutely love the idea of the DisposaKups. However, after using a few, they just don't live up to my expectations. The lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done brewing, sometimes the holes don't poke properly, and every time i am left with water spewing out in all directions while it brews. Definitely not a replacement for MyK or Solofill.","1909":"They look like a good idea.  My wife and I thought we would give them a try.  They are pretty easy to use.  The thing we don't like is the mess they make in the machine.  Even when to top is secure, they leak into the machine. You have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky.  I would advise you to use something better like the E-Z Cup.","1910":"This is what is needed to use with finely ground coffees. It works well. With none fine ground coffee I prefer using my Solo Fill Cups they are easier to use. I have had six for some time and have had no problem except when using fine ground coffee.","1911":"Neat concept. Other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the K-Cup. This is like a do it yourself K-Cup. However, because this consists of a disposable cup, filter, and a cap and is punched by the brewer, I would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on Keurig's patents. Oh, and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website :)","1912":"I'm not happy with these reusuable cups ! They don't hold enough coffee so when using the Keuring system, I get a small cup of coffee intead of the middle button. I hope Keurig comes out with a better reusable k cup holder.","1913":"The cups are a little tight for my machine. You have to press down on the handle really hard. Also the lids don't fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup.","1914":"Not thrilled with these.  Doubt I will buy them again.  Lid doesn't fit very well.  Messy and did not make a good cup of coffee.  Cost including shipping to me was .36\/filter cup plus coffee. Don't think it is worth it as I can buy a Green Mountain K-Cup for around .54\/cup and they are perfect every time.","1915":"i bought these for my pittie who is on a sweet potato and fish diet.  i thought they would be a little larger, but they are more suitable for a smaller breed dog.  they were even a little small for my pug who gulped them down and i was afraid she would choke on them.","1916":"My Seth is a huge fan of spicy things, the hotter the better. I was hoping these would go over really well, and be a regular snack. He likes them, but just that. I got him the Ass Kickin' Snack Mix, and he devoured it, wolfing it down, so We'll stick with that. I'd still consider this a great buy if you love peanuts. And it's a great price.","1917":"My Experience:  It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.  Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much.","1918":"They do not taste like a good high quality nut, i dont know if it was the lack of salt but they were not for me","1919":"I enjoyed the dry roasted part, but the Onion-Garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me.  I thought that they would be a little more \"toasted\" than they were.  The flavor was more of an after taste and my wife shied away from my kisses after I ate them -- bummer!  I am looking for something else.","1920":"The flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them. If that doesn't bother you, then they're a great low-carb snack.","1921":"The pumpkin seeds I received from the Bob's Red Mill company were stale and contained a lot of small seed fragments.","1922":"I made the mistake of thinking that this product was simply Brown sugar flavored Splenda. I didn't read the product details stating that it actually has brown sugar in it.. My mistake...","1923":"This is not what one should expect from a black truffle, but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle. It is cheap, but there is a reason for that: there is no taste and no smell at all. I was disappointed when I tried this truffle, but I realized that the price was that for a reason. At least it can be used to add a colour to your dish.","1924":"This is a pretty good cup of tea. I just wish PG Tips made pods for the Keurig brewer.  Maybe eventually!","1925":"The product was fair, not as \"country\" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store.","1926":"This tea has mostly all raspberry flavours with little to no peach at all.  I added a peach green tea bag when I brew it & a little sweetener.  It's very tough to taste the \"sparkling wine\" flavour, either.  At best, it's a nice raspberry green tea, but it's certainly not what I was expecting & hoping for.  If I bought it from a store, I would have taken it back.","1927":"The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans I've bought from a local grocery store.  I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Puck's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore.  Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously.  Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit.","1928":"I had ordered a case of this incredible soup, based on my experience of ordering it at the the Dallas Fort Worth resturant. It was so incredible that I ordered another container to go, couldnt stop thinking about it during my meeting in Dallas and ordered two more before my flight back to California. I went out of my way to go to this terminal so I could order it again.  So when I got the canned version....not as impressed. Oh well.","1929":"It's all natural, no artificial color, no weird ingredients . . . but it also has no taste. The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade.","1930":"I ordered this item and was not pleased when it arrived, however the seller promptly contacted me to make things right. They refunded my purchase in full after requesting a photo of the item. Their response was quick and much appreciated. I will likely not purchase plants online any longer, however, if I do, I would not hesitate to consider this seller again mainly because of their customer service.","1931":"The plant looked great the day it arrived. With that said, the arrival took an extra week to get here. After the first day one of the heads turned blacked and i had to remove it. I give it 4 hours of direct sunlight a day and always keep the media wet. I never use tap water. Only rain and purifies water. I still have yet to see any of the heads open. I'm very nervous that they will not ever open. Maybe they will send me another one :\/","1932":"Its smaller than I expected. I dont think 3 inches is as big as it used to be. It comes in this clear goofy plastic box that told me to use said box as a humidity dome. I don't remember seeing a dome in the little shop movie but I tried it anyway. A day later my plant was burned and never recovered.  I'd give it more stars if the directions were more clear. It was cool seeing the heads close up on things.","1933":"The plant came very healthy but smaller then described. It was described as a large Venus fly trap I received a medium size Venus fly trap but it was a healthy one even fed before it was shipped being that I paid a reasonable price for it's unexpected size I don't believe I loss on this one in fact I am pleased with the plant.","1934":"I received the plant in great condition but soon killed it. The directions said not to fertalize it and exactly what to plant it in. So, I bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid gro in it so it died within 3 days. My seven year old loved it while he had it though. He even named it, fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet!","1935":"On the label it says, \"1\/3 less sugar\" than regular peanut butter.  If you read the fine print, it is because it 1\/3 less peanut butter!  That being said, it is very tasty.","1936":"My golden retriever loves these bones!  I ordered them and they arrived in a timely manner.  However, when I opened the box, they were old - meaning the filling was somewhat dried and didn't completely fill the hoof due to shrinkage.  Once the plastic is removed, the filling pretty much falls out.  Very disappointing!","1937":"I grew up in NJ and the local Italian food store sold this sauce along with dough and cheese that you could take home to make your own pizza! I loved it then, and I love it now.  The only issue is the price.  At almost 4$ per can it would be hard to justify the cost.  So to be clear, 5 stars for the sauce, but 1 star for the price!","1938":"It's OK,but it is not as good as Meyenberg's fresh goatmilk in the carton.It sort of has a waters down taste.!","1939":"I don't find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form; I've had fresh goat milk and frankly, this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form. It does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use. Certain bread, pancakes and the like do very well if I add this mix instead of other milks or water. Good to have in the pantry for those \"just-in case\" days.","1940":"I love Jell-o No Bake Cheesecake but was disappointed the shelf life was so short. I got it after Christmas and the expiration date was April 8,2011.  Had I known that before I ordered I would have never ordered.  12 boxes is a lot to use up in only 3 months. I will not order again.","1941":"I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me.","1942":"My husband says these pretzels are great and he loves them.  However, on the box I saw a warning that says the pretzels are made in a facility that produces peanut butter.  Therefore, I can't eat them.  So for those of you with peanut\/nut allergy I would urge caution.","1943":"In an effort to reverse augmenting high blood pressure, a physician recommended I drink hibiscus herbal tea. Kudos to Celebration Herbals for delivering the tea one day after the order was placed. I followed instructions on the box and used spring water which was  steeped for approximately ten minutes. Although the primary reason for drinking the tea was medicinal, I also wanted a flavorable tea. Sadly the taste of the tea was unexceptional. Accordingly, the next box of hibiscus tea that I purchase will not be from Celebration Herbals.","1944":"I like the taste, but the store does not always has this.  Some-how it tastes different from the one in the store, much weaker caffeine and aroma...","1945":"The product was fair, not as \"country\" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store.","1946":"I bought this because I was craving dark chocolate, and thought mint sounded great at the time. The chocolate is way too sweet. Dark chocolate is supposed to be a little bitter, not too much, but enough to give it some bite. I guess Ghirardelli decided to cancel that out by adding more sugar. Add to it the super sweet mint filling, and I could barely finish a square it was so sweet. Considering the expense, I expected a much better quality.","1947":"Although it is very high in protein, I thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland. I would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough.","1948":"Coffee is good but I don't care for individual pacs. Would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed.","1949":"These guys are quite high on the nutritional scale but on these marinated morsels varieties, well, they hate them.  They get stuck in my cats' teeth and although it can be quite comical watching them afterwards, it just ins't worth them only eating about half a can and tossing the rest down the garbage disposal.  I recommend them for the nutritional value and please try them if you cat loves chicken.  My rescue loves many of the other varieties and this stuff has improved her quality of life tremendously. Recommend!","1950":"I have 4 cats, and none of them really like these treats. They will eat them eventually, but the certainly don't go wild for them. I do like that grain and chicken free, so they are good for cats with allergies.","1951":"I really wanted my 2 yr old cat to like these treats because I already feed her Wellness wet food, which is excellent by itself. Perhaps she's too used to the Whiskas Temptations that I normally give her, but she did not like the jerky bits at all. I did notice it was hard for her to pick up because they're pretty flat, and the texture is chewier than what she's used to. The 3rd time I gave her the treats, she vomited it out. Looks like it's back to the less healthy alternative.","1952":"I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, he'll eat them, but it's not the type of treat he'll do tricks for or run over to eat. It's a healthier alternative to other treats, but I wouldn't buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior. These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat.","1953":"This product is really a hit or miss. My cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats....Sometimes he does not eat these right away.","1954":"I liked that these treats didn't have anything gross in them (i.e., corn, wheat, soy, by-products).  My cats don't really care for salmon, but i thought since it was mixed with turkey, which they love, they might like them. Well they didn't, they took one sniff and wanted nothing to do with them.  Though my inside cats didn't want them, the stray cats outside loved them.","1955":"We have ordered Elecare from this shipper twice.  The first time, we received it next day and were very happy.  The second time, it arrived next day as well, but two of the cans had opened and the box got wet, causing the inside of the box to be covered in clumps of spoiled formula.  When we used one of the unopened cans (we had to since we had nothing else to feed the baby and this product is not sold in stores) the baby became sick for several days.","1956":"As a fan of English & Irish breakfast teas, I found this tea to be very weak flavored.  If you like milder\/weaker teas, this may be for you.  But if you like more robust flavors, steer clear of this one.","1957":"This is a wonderful product...but it comes in a paper bag  which is easy to puncture and when you ship it in a box with no bubble wrap it slides around a lot and you start to get leakage of the product....powder everywhere.  I would order it again if I was sure it would be packaged right so it wouldn't be sliding around in the box.","1958":"Great product and nice taste, glad they sell it online, not sure where to buy it in the local supermarket, it was a decent price, $2.11, I just thought that the shipping fee of $4.99 seemed high, but the product seems great!","1959":"Purchased three pounds.  Arrived well packaged.  Am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend.  This is good, but not great...we'll keep on looking.","1960":"The coffee was not stale as some have had, but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this.  I believe a better product could be had with the same beans.","1961":"We had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting, rich flavor to us.  For some reason, this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison.  The search for the perfect peaberry coffee continues...","1962":"Bought this product to give to a family member who lives cross country and is going thru treatment for cancer.  Lemongrass tea is supposed to help with side-effects of radiation and chemotherapy. I tried it as well.  Have had other products containing lemongrass tea that tasted better.  Still, good value for the price and could probably be mixed with other teas to improve taste.","1963":"When I read the description of this it said mini - these are regular size.  Tastes great but my 86 year old mom wants the mini ones and I have not been able to find the smaller dine size ones.","1964":"I WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET THIS THEN I HAD A CUP, I NEVER MADE IT THRU THE CUP... IT IS SO SWEET IT IS SICKENING REALLY, NOW I HAVE TO FIND FAMILY TO PAWN THIS STUFF ONTO AND CHRISTMAS IS A LONG WAY OFF...LOL","1965":"I really wanted this food to work, as it seems to have good ingredients for a decent price.  However, my cats, who are typically ravenous little mongrels, don't even bother to check it out when offered.  So much for saving a couple of bucks--now they eat Organix.","1966":"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try. The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short.","1967":"Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth.","1968":"As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.  If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002L41Y8A\">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)<\/a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for.","1969":"This flavored K-Cup isn't out of this world, but isn't horrible. In my opinion, it's way more flavorful than the Wolfgang Puck Hazelnut K-Cup. We love flavored coffee in our house, and so I would go with this one again. Worth a try.","1970":"I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe.","1971":"Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild.","1972":"This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor. I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf. I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine. In the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small I did not even consider looking on it. So just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering.","1973":"Good, but the Green Mountain reserve Sumatra is better by 1- 1 and a half stars. Sort of tastes a little stale.","1974":"I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it.","1975":"If you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee, this may not be for you.  I couldn't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew, but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better.","1976":"I love my Keurig but haven't found my \"perfect\" cup of coffee yet, although this comes close. I prefer a medium brew, not bold or strong. Breakfast in Bed is my choice so far.","1977":"I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.","1978":"The coffee is good,however the k-cup is not packaged well,the coffee machine barely streams coffee,more of a fast drip.  The whole idea is it's fast,right?","1979":"The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money.","1980":"Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.","1981":"More than a \"hint\" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK.","1982":"This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, you'll like this.  Generally, the GM product costs less, but this was on sale.","1983":"I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1\/3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup.  I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k-cup is not puffy like it has pressure, but flat and wrinkled.","1984":"It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion.","1985":"This is less of a \"bold\" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first.","1986":"The coffee is just OK. It's very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right.","1987":"Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck?","1988":"I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I don't have to order quite so often.","1989":"I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.","1990":"I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really can't make out any carmel flavor.","1991":"I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  I'll be going back to Emeril's Jazz'd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee People's French Roast Decaf.  So far I've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee don't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you'd probably enjoy this one.","1992":"I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.  I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K-Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.  The decaf 24-count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K-cups and is as yummy as the high test!","1993":"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!","1994":"The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck.","1995":"I prefer the \"extra bold\" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead.","1996":"Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning.","1997":"I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. It's not available on \"subscribe and save\" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but it's very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me.","1998":"We love Hazelnut coffee, but this just didn't have enough coffee flavor in it for me. Kind of on the weak side in my opinion. I'll keep looking.","1999":"K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1\/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, what's the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think it's a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? That's a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!! jb","2000":"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.","2001":"Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.","2002":"The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.","2003":"After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.  It's OK coffee.  I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones.  To gauge my review for others, my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, and Tully's Kona Blend.","2004":"I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees.","2005":"This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend. It just doesn't taste as good.","2006":"This is a great flavored coffee nevertheless, K-cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use.  I am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time. It's also helpful to look for other price alternatives.","2007":"Disappointing... while folks like to say tofu has no flavor, I can discern  a type of neutrality and this one is the blankest of blank slates  Wet, watery, gelatinous, it is not a product i will buy again soon. I got it because shopping is a challenge.  It's not awful, just disappointing. The benefits are the packaging and that is has shelf life.","2008":"Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste?","2009":"I bought duck rillettes from Amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by chefshop.com. I was expecting a really good rillette. Full flavored rillette. What I got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs\/spices. The texture was good however. Tasted more like a pork rillette. I would not recommend Rouge Perigord Duck Rillettes.","2010":"The product description says you are purchasing 6 boxes of 25 tea bags. I received only one box. I called amazon and they said that the quantity I received was correct and the description is wrong. They made it right, but shouldn't have had to. Beware!!","2011":"This is really a normal taste coffee. I would not buy more after I finish this one. In fact, I will still be sleepy after drinking two cups!","2012":"The party I had you send this product to, is ENJOYING it immensley. He is unable to purchase this product in Arizona.Obviously, certain products are not available in his location and I was happy to help out. I want to thank you for your quick response in securing this request and I am sure he will look to order it in the future. Thank You...mario","2013":"Not quiet what I was expecting.  The cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy.  The dark chocolate was good but too crunchy.","2014":"Honestly these cookies could have been better. I would buy them again if the shipping wasn't so ridiculous! I think it ended up being like 15 dollars for a few tiny cookies. What a ripoff.","2015":"This decaf is OK.  It is a Medium Roast, not a dark roast (says it on the can, but not in the description here).  Also, unlike another reviewer, I think that it is ground very fine.","2016":"We've only used this once, but it kept us awake most of the night.  We were surprised because it's decaf, but we couldn't sleep for hours after going to bed.  Tastes good, though.","2017":"I was thinking of purchasing these Oakcakes.  However, in reading the ingredients, I don't see Oats listed. Are these Oakcakes without Oats?  Wheat Flour, Vegetable Oils, Sugar, Wheat Bran, Invert Sugar Syrups, Salt, Skimmed Milk Powder, Raising Agent","2018":"These steaks came out really good, but the bacon doesn't have much flavor and doesn't seem to add to the steaks.  The size of the steaks are perfect though and I would recommend it unless you are looking for a lot of bacon flavor.","2019":"If your dog likes Naked bars then this is the same consistency. It's hard and sometimes my dog will eat it sometimetimes he'll just leave it. It's quite hard.","2020":"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.

I was guzzling it down like, well, water, daily. I don't really enjoy plain water a lot of the time, but this provided refreshment, hydration, and flavor without a lot of the junk and\/or calories that other drinks come with. 5 stars.  I was looking forward to continuing buying it and consuming it regularly with subscribe and save. However....  Price, specifically change in price, is terrible. 1 star. I cannot say more.","2063":"Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out. If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.","2064":"This product worked well for small cakes.  It also tasted great.  For any cakes over 12 inches, it just would pull until their was a hole in it.  It is almost too soft a product.","2065":"I wanted to try this coffee once in my life. I was very happy with the company that mailed it, and the timely manner in which they sent it.","2066":"haven't used it yet , but if going by past Marshal Creek products ... ? should be good.","2067":"The blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys. I was having trouble finding it in the local stores that I shop so I thought I would shop for this online. I was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store. I don't think I will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when I shop locally.","2068":"These tablets did work, but were not nearly as effective as I had expected.  I set up an entire spread of foods, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, liquids etc to try and when my friends and I allowed the tablets to dissolve, they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time (maybe 5-10 min?)","2069":"They do make sour stuff sweet for a bit, but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor... great novelty item.","2070":"I tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations. Most tasted slightly different. Some got a sweet tickling in the mouth. I got the strongest effects from vinegar, ketchup\/mustard and Salt-vinegar chips. But nothing tasted miraculously better as I had expected. As others have pointed out, everyone reacts differently. The two other people I did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well. One experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me. You could try this if you are interested but I wouldn't buy it again.","2071":"I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good. It is just a little watery tasting. Land of the lakes is better. But they dont have sugar free. So for sugar free I can give a heads up on this product.","2072":"This is an OK hot cocoa. I had been using Land O'Lakes product, but wanted to try this for a change. The taste is comparable, but the portions in each packet is smaller. I still like Land O'Lakes hot cocoa better.","2073":"This product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very detrimental to your health. I would rather pay more for a product which does not contain transfats.","2074":"This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!  I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.","2075":"I was really disappointed in this coffee.  It's a darker roast than i was expecting and the bag has no expiration date.  My coffee tasted quite stale and old.","2076":"The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.","2077":"Delivery of the product was quick, however the items are smaller than how they appear on line. Next time I would order the larger size.","2078":"An otherwise good gum reduced to a three-star review by really mind-boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil-covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.  The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more.","2079":"My cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors. I dare not run out of these treats or I might have a kitty uprising!","2080":"This simple yet tasteless product did what it said it would, thicken gravy and soups. This product in my opinion should be used in the morning before work or people who are studing late nights as Chia makes you energized.","2081":"I bought these to put in smoothies and they do not totally grind up in the blender.  I am going to try to grind them by hand before i add to the blender. It all depends on your texture preference.  I do not mind seeds from fruits but these bugged me!","2082":"This is a pleasant tea, it tastes mostly of chamomile.  Unfortunately for me, it doesn't do too much to squelch heartburn.  I'm now 36 weeks along and have had heartburn almost the whole time, and I was hoping this would help out but it really hasn't had an effect. I do like the tea just as a mild beverage, but I can't recommend it for pregnancy related heartburn.","2083":"Got this as a gift for the office.  It's nice to get people to take a break from work to see what they get.  Unfortunately, its not well mixed.  It's almost gone and so far, all the black ones are not the licorice (and that is the good flavor compared to the other one, ick!), same goes to the white ones and the there was only one pair of the blue to be played :(","2084":"Taste is just Ok, a bit greasy compare to 94% fat free micro kettle pop corn bags (purchases here at better cost.) Coconut flavor is like coconut flakes flavoring. Not a good value since you get 18 bags for $30. Purchased it because I wondered about it since I love Coconut. Won't buy again because of the greasy feeling and high cost.","2085":"Gave it to my daughter who uses it in recipes but I wanted to use it in smoothies.  It tasted to bad to me.","2086":"I am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees.  This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.  While the coffee is good, I don't find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive.","2087":"I bought this coffee in Jamaica ($15 for 1 lb bag).  While I liked and enjoyed it, I prefer several coffees from my local shops at about the same price.  I think that it may have been worth the $15\/lb, but no more.  Certainly not at these prices.","2088":"Went to Jamaica last May and brought about 6 pounds of this and the Waldenford's Blue Mtn back with me. About half what you are paying here, but still not worth the money. It is good coffee. No question. But don't believe all the hype. I am a casual coffee drinker and someone that takes coffee more seriously might get more benefit from this coffee. To me, not the case. I order my Peet's Arabian Mocha Java online for about $14\/lb and it is still my favorite coffee.","2089":"We own a small neighborhood bar and the patrons enjoy having the novelty of fresh, hot pork rinds served to them with their beverages.","2090":"taste is not like other pork rinds.  but does not taste bad.  when you microwave them, the bag only pops up about half way.  when its done popping and you eat them immediately, they are pretty hot and seem to melt in your mouth.  needing much water and a brushing to get the rinds and the taste out of your mouth afterwards.  I think the idea is pretty good, but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion.","2091":"These are an okay snack. They don't puff up like the Pork Rinds I have had in the past. The quantity of rinds in the bag seems lacking. There is a unusual taste as if some type of seasoning added that I can't figure out. If you want a salty snack with no carbs they are okay, I, however, will not buy them again. I'll stick with the regular puffed up ones or cracklings. These don't fit in either category quite the way I expected.","2092":"I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt.","2093":"Takes at least three minutes in my Micro, and some are singed while some are still old maids. Good flavor but just a little salty for me. I do not recommend.","2094":"I've been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really \"spicy\", they're more like mild in my opinion. They are good, they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store, not \"bacon-y\" at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. It's pretty bad, I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of.","2095":"I bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the Food Network.  It does taste good.  You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.  This doesn't work the same as microwave popcorn.  The \"bake\" time is quite short, and overcooked pork rinds aren't pretty or tasty.  I think that in the future, if I want warm pork rinds, I'll try warming up a small batch of my usual brand in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes.","2096":"I like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture (some are really really hard, while others are what you would expect).  You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, it's hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste.","2097":"'On July 26, 2012 I ordered Lowrey's Hot and Spicy Pork Rinds. I received the Orginal Pork Rinds. I am not happy with this product. I will keep them as they will be to expensive to send them back. I feel you should have checked my previous orders I had ordered, or at least contacted me about my order. Thank you, Colleen Avey","2098":"I bought these on another online site and the Amazon ones are almost $3 cheaper. I love these. In fact, I've grown quite addicted. Unfortunatley, they have tons of sodium and also contain MSG, which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively. If I were only trying to maintain, these wouldn't be a problem.  I won't buy them again, for these reasons.","2099":"THE PRODUCT, BEING NEW, IS FAIR, BUT HAVE NOT HAD TOO MUCH LUCK GETTING IT TO EXPAND MUCH....HAVE TOOOOOOO MANY FLAT HARD PIECES....FLAVOR IS OKAY, BUT HAS A GREASY TASTE TO START, LIKE IT'S BEEN SITTING IN BACON GREASE..I HAVE TRUST THAT IN TIME THE PRODUCT WILL IMPROVE AS ALL NEW PRODUCTS DO, ....I THINK IT IS A GOOD CONCEPT AND HOPE IT DOES GET BETTER","2100":"These taste just like any other packaged pork rind product I've tried. I was hoping these would be fresher, closer to the real thing I buy in Mexican markets. Oh well, for a quick snack when you don't feel like leaving the house, it's fine.","2101":"I had trouble finding just the right amount of time to microwave Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds and now that I have they're okay, but I doubt I will buy them again...I ruined quite a few in the process.","2102":"This chili is filling and mildly spicy. Cooks well, however it makes exploding noises in my microwave.","2103":"Keep box of saltines nearby and nuke this stuff and it's about the best lunch out of a microwave that I have ever had in my 45 years of working. Nice and thick, no weird burnt spices, mystery meat, but they all have that. I will buy this again.","2104":"One of the disappointments with Campbell's Chunky Chili is that the \"meat\" is chewy and doesn't really taste like meat. Overall, the chili is acceptable as a quick lunch alternative but don't expect anything resembling homemade chili.","2105":"Campbell's makes some great soups,but their chili on the other hand,leaves alot to be desired,it's tastes okay,just not up to snuff,I prefer Hormel(w\/ or w\/out beans) or even better HOMEADE!!!(and I make a mean chili,no compalints yet!!!)","2106":"Taste is not bad and there is plenty of beans and beef. Too much sodium. If you have high blood pressure, this product is a no, no.","2107":"Not as good as the reviews led me to expect. Despite great color and good viscosity, the syrup's flavor lacked intensity.  I'll continue my quest elsewhere.","2108":"The coffee is overall OK.  I had to make it strong for it to taste good. When made weak it wasn't very good. My spouse didn't like it however I made it (personal taste). I used whole beans in a Breville YouBrew grinder\/coffee maker. I'm glad that I tried it as Kona blend is suppose to be very good. Three stars!","2109":"The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees I've tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good.","2110":"I really like this granola - their hemp granola is my favorite. REALLY good stuff. However - it's just too sweet for my taste. Most granola is dreadfully sugar-laden, and other than the healthy ingredients, I feel like I'm chomping on some commercial-grade grocery store sugar cereal... -___-  That said, the texture is very satisfying and it is tasty. Just a bit sweet. You've been warned.. ;)","2111":"I usually order this item from Amazon since our local grocery stores (Walmart and Safeway) do not carry it, but. . .I would expect that buying in bulk would be cheaper, but instead, six bags of 26.4 ounces is eight cents PER OUNCE more expensive than buying six boxes of 11.5 ounces.  Shouldn't it be the other way around? This is not a savings at all.","2112":"the meat has some flavor i feel it could have a little more and also the slices are very thin so they burn quick if you dont pay attention. the cucumber sause from the same place is amazing though!","2113":"I have been researching the web to find some gyro strips and this is the most expensive so far, maybe look elsewhere?","2114":"3 months later and I STILL HAVE 1 more box, after giving away the other TWO boxes lol. There's no taste in butter and although it's a reasonable price, It's too simple, no flavor and you can sometimes get burned popcorn even though the same timing worked for the same PACKAGE and the same MICROWAVE (so never leave your popcorn unattended)!","2115":"Have generally enjoyed this product over a few years-but found that one container (of 6-1 lb. size that I was shipped) so far had quite inferior ghee-with the milk fat still present-made me a bit sick-and threw away rest of container.","2116":"Although I loved the ease and price of making this purchase online, when it arrived over half of the cans were very severely dented.  A few so much so that it was almost impossible to order them.  I definitely have to reconsider where I purchase this in the future.","2117":"these are great tasting candies for a sugar-free variety, but they get sticky and very hard to take out of the individual wrappers, especially without getting the candy all over your fingers.","2118":"My basenji, Lily, loves Rawhide Munchy Sticks Beef 5\" 100 Pack and Chicken, 5\" 100 Pack best, but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well.  I guess she is not too picky.","2119":"The Grape Jam, itself, is of the highest quality, and it tastes great, so I have absolutely no complaints there. However, the glass jars were poorly packaged (it was very heavy and fragile, and was insulated with just two small pillow puffs), and two of the twelve jars arrived with the seals already broken. Since I could not be sure if the food was safe to eat, I had to throw away the two jars. I would not order this product again(or anything else that comes in jars) for that reason.","2120":"I like my hot chocolate to have alot of \"chocolatey\" flavor. Even when I use the smallest size brewing cup the Green Mountain hot cocoa K-cups tastes watered down. I have to add my own powdered hot chocolate to give it enough flavor.","2121":"This product wad very weak! I couldn't even make out that it was supposed to be hot chocolate. Will never buy again a waste of money!","2122":"I thought that getting hot cocoa would be a nice change, but after having my machine get clogged up, needing to clean the needles, and then putting a rinse brew after each cup is made, I've found it faster to stick with the packet of instant mix and heat water in the microwave.","2123":"I would not order these K-cups again.  Maybe I'm spoiled with Godiva hot chocolate, but I think Swiss Miss hot chocolate has more chocolately flavor than these K-cups and I wouldn't waste my money on these.  It comes out a pinkish color that is not appetizing at all.","2124":"Guys, do you know what \"malossol\" means in Russian? \"Lightly salted\". This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit. Other than that its a very good tasting caviar (I guess you can blame a puddlefish for that), very close to Russian Sturgeon's caviar.","2125":"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to \"tenderized\" the pieces for my old kitty cat.","2126":"I bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food I usually fed her.  She likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal.  The ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied.","2127":"The one BIG problem being that they don't always send you the right product and when that happens there is no way to return it for the right product. I ordered 2 lbs of the honey and received brown sugar instead. When I tried to return it for the right product (the honey) I got absolutely NO RESPONSE. None. I sent countless emails, but nothing. It is a great product with a great taste, but the company is a little dodgy, so be careful.","2128":"OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat.","2129":"I love these almonds. They are my favorite to date and I would definitely buy again. The taste is crunchy, they are well toasted and the salt that has been added is just perfect. Not too little, not too much. Best I have ever eaten!!","2130":"I am a little dis appointed with this tea --  This was my first experience with loose tea --  initially this was good loose tea ---  after having tried for several months  -- I am dis appointed -- first it is a weak tea  --  I have tried brewing it  for long time changing my water settings and brew times and I keep getting same result  a weak tea  -- the amt of tea --  I just never seem to get the right mix  --","2131":"Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea.  Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles.","2132":"The dark chocolates were great and the packaging was great for Christmas The tin was something you dont see in America anymore. Perfect to reuse for candy or other things at christmas.","2133":"I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it's changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW that's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I won't miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers.","2134":"I was expecting some \"serious flavor\" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.","2135":"Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.  The product has more sunflower, corn and canola oils than it does olive oil!! The ingredients are NOT listed in the description.  I should have known better. There are other, much better \"Olive Oil\" potato chips on the market that use ONLY olive oil. I was quite disappointed in this brand.","2136":"I ordered these because I had purchased a bag of Sweet maui Onion chips from the supermarket. They were so good that I had to get another.  The order came and I popped open a bag. They are very crunchy, so if you're into that, these are the chips for you. However, they do tend to get really salty. I found myself having quite a few sips of beer when eating these","2137":"I bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients... but also specifically because they are gluten free.  I have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten... or Milk.  I was so upset when I received these to find out that they contain Milk!  I do not see this information anywhere on the product page.","2138":"These are great treats - in fact they are the only thing I use for my dog.  But this price seem way wrong - so far off as to possibly be incorrect??  In my local PetSmart they are $5.99.","2139":"Stuff inside is good. But olive oil containers should be dark to block sunlight. And I prefer glass containers to plastic.","2140":"If you like an almond this is a good product and it is cheaper than the name brand. To me this product taste the same as the name brand, I like paying less and having the same taste!","2141":"I should have been more aware of the price at local stores for this product.  Walgreens had these exact almonds for $2 less\/per bag that week.  They are delicious, though.","2142":"Purchased this item to try.  Had to purchase the case, I believe 3 big bottles.  It wasn't what I expected, but now I have 3 big bottles to use.  I will share at work and with my family, if I can get them to take some.","2143":"I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang)","2144":"I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.","2145":"I found these for 1\/2 the cost on the direct website with a free gift of lava cakes as well. Makes a great gift :)","2146":"Brew style: french press, espresso Smell: Nothing special here, decent 'coffee' smell with some earthiness.  No caramel notes, no sweetness. Taste: Mild, earthy, somewhat smokey, dirty mouth feel, finish is short.  I mostly brew with a french press but i tried it in my espresso maker just to see how it would fair.  The caffeine seemed very pronounced to me, there was no sweetness to speak of.  It did have a very nice crema though. Overall: I wont be buying this again, its nothing special.","2147":"Read the reviews and thought this coffee was 5 stars.  Received the coffee and proceeded to open the package. What wasn't there was any aroma. Had to stick my nose inside the package to even smell if it was coffee. Caramel? Well I proceeded to brew a cup. Smelled like normal 3 star coffee, tasted like plain ole coffee. Nothing special just plain ole coffee.","2148":"camerons organic velvet moon is way better. Comparing the two products this product isn't what it is hyped up to be.","2149":"I loved the packs with the flavors, except the chocolate covered. They were horribly melted into one great big discolored glob. Figures, with temps over 100 in SoCal everyday during the summer. I can't blame anyone. It is what it is.","2150":"Excellent size and not too many are broken, but they may be RAW, not ROASTED, so beware. Would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options.  I bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant, so would buy again IF they were prepared (or presented) properly.  UPDATE: Contacted the vendor, who apparently has a problem with English, and does the \"run around\" game, so BEWARE.","2151":"Purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it.I didn't find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok.If you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor I wouldnt be able to.Maybe because I know its supposed to be macadamia nut that Im looking for the flavor and can find it?In the end I am still trying to find  good macadamia nut flavor.","2152":"Tasty Syrup, but I was walking the aisle at my local superstore and found the exact same product for $3 less. And I don't live anywhere near vermont. Ah well - its still great stuff! And my pancakes thank me.","2153":"at $12 for 2.1 ounces, no wonder one can't pull up the bag to see details. Like $80 per pound!","2154":"I was thinking 1 lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be. Especially since starch is somewhat light, and since it was $8. I wish they sold this in larger quantities.","2155":"I frequently buy Post Shredded Wheat, and decided to try this new cereal because it's made of whole grain wheat.  My teenage children had the same opinion about Caramel Delight that I did...they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack, but it's way too sweet as a cereal!  General Mills should reduce the sugar, and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal. That would make it perfect!","2156":"I bought this -- just one box, not a six-pack -- on sale at a store. I can't believe how easy it is to get your fiber if you eat this cereal. Most cereals don't have even half this much fiber in them.","2157":"The best in fiber, as crunchy flakes.  Great as is or topped with fruit plus added skim milk or yogurt and you have a fresh start to your day!","2158":"This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. I've enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product.","2159":"Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large\/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult\/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).","2160":"For a friend who loves jellies and turtles . He said they were soft and chewy just the ways he likes them and even though they were his favourite animal he couldn't stop eating em .","2161":"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again.","2162":"These seeds are on the edge of their sell by date. (11\/11)  Not very good for the small scale gardener who wants to save some for next year.  Germination rates are at about 1\/4.  Too early to tell much about the plants, but I will update again if they do well.","2163":"This isn't the best tasting pepperoni, but it's acceptable, and you certainly get a lot of it for the money.","2164":"This does NOT taste like peperoni. More like Slim Jim, except this uses real sausage casing (Slim Jim uses paper...shhh.)","2165":"I've recently been researching the work of Dr. Price and the X-factor that high vitamin butter, combined with fermented cod liver oil, will cause teeth to re-mineralize and stop tooth decay. If this is why you want to purchase this product, DO NOT. I'm sure it's fine for ghee, but when I switched from the pricey butter oil to this, I found cavities were growing. When I switched back, they stopped growing. Again, this is great for ghee, but don't use as part of preventing\/curing tooth decay as Dr. Price's research recommends.","2166":"I love Orville Redenbacher and so I ordered a case. Unfortunately, It looks old and the bags are weeping butter. The popcorn tastes OK when it does fully pop, if you can get pass that...what am I saying? Buy the 3 pack and try it out first.","2167":"Is this price correct?  $46.34 works out at over $7 a lb!  I am sorry, but for this price I would not buy from this supplier.  This is just a ridiculous price.  Walnuts can be purchased ANYWHERE for less than $5. per lb.","2168":"It is a nice looking storage option and saves space, but I expected the drawer to slide out without so much difficulty. It is very jerky and tough to pull out and and push in. I thought maybe I did something wrong but it is pretty simple. I applied some WD 40 to the slide (with much wiping to get the excess off) and that did not help. Has anyone else had this trouble, and were you able to remedy it?","2169":"First off I'm very happy that my Keurig Coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space. But on the other hand it's difficult to reach the last K-cup in the very back of the drawer. I can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access.","2170":"I don't know if I have bad one (doubt it), but it doesn't slide well unless you lift up on it.  It's like the tracks are too tight, and if you try pulling straight out, it hangs, and then the cups inside go flying when it finally does slide because you end up jerking it.","2171":"When I added this to the cake it was so beautiful that I couldn't believe it! Even the customer was impressed! It made the cake look more professional for someone who's still learning to make beautiful cakes.","2172":"The cookies at first taste good but it follows up with an interesting after taste.  It is also a little dry had to down a whole glass of milk but overall it wasn't too bad.","2173":"It is just okay to me. This product's flavor does not impress me as much as the vegan choc chunk ones offered by Erin.","2174":"I love Erin's Breakfast Cookies, but this flavor is a little to rich for me.  It gives me that funny feeling in the back of my throat.","2175":"If I hadn't scored these during a Warehouse sell-off, I'd even more seriously fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things. Sure, the instructions are dead-on with the freeze-before-toasting method, but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies I can make at home for MUCH cheaper, and with superior texture and without the garbage. If you think these are healthy OR a good value, you've been duped.","2176":"I bought these walnuts hoping they'd have a fresh, natural taste, better than the packaged nuts I find at my local grocery.  Unfortunately, the nuts I received had somehow absorbed a strong taste of plastic.  I took them out of the plastic tubs they were packed in and put them in another container I use that does not transfer odors or tastes onto the food.  Even so, after several weeks these nuts still tasted very unpleasantly of plastic.","2177":"I buy these crackers because I need something gluten free to snack with.  But why does gluten free have to be so salty? I have to wipe the salt off to be able to eat them.  Wish the manufacturers would learn that just because we are glten free doesn't mean we can eat all that salt.  Less salt please!","2178":"The product is a known value to us and is fresh. The physical condition of the  product leaves something to be desired. The individual wafers are often broken up, to the extent of 30% of the contents of the package. This indicates careless packing for the rigors of package shipment. The use of a somewhat larger outside box with the air bag padding on all sides should be better for the physical care of the contents. My wife eats the thins for lunch very often with meat, cheese or fish and finds the broken ones unsatisfactory.","2179":"I've purchaesed twice so far and in both boxes the gum was really hard.  Product is great, but I wouldn't purchase again through amazon due to it being so hard to chew.","2180":"This is a really dark roast coffee which I usually like.  It has a bite to it but the bold\/complex flavors and aroma weren't quite there by my taste.  I tried it in a coffee press, drip and a steam coffee machine that we have at the office but couldn't find that sweet spot that would make it work for me.  I'm a little bias because I picked up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001EO5PB0\">Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Colombia Supremo Decaf Whole Bean Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)<\/a> at about the same time to compare and absolutely love Jeremiah's.","2181":"My dog refuses to eat these snacks.  I was expected that these snacks have a strong liver smell, however they smell like plastic...","2182":"My dog is crazy for the Dogswell chicken strips but these she's not excited about. These are crunchy like a pressed cracker, not a meat strip, and not as chewy.","2183":"We have purchased these treats several times for our aging Bichon and been well pleased.  She loves them; however, this last batch is tough and really dried out.","2184":"These are a good cookie. I was hoping for something lighter but in all they had a good taste but no real crunch. Unfortunately just about every cracker arrived broken or nearly smashed. Perhaps we will add them to vanilla ice cream.....","2185":"I ordered these to make s'mores. I liked the ingredient list, no HFCS. However, they come more like a box of Wheat Thins. They are not large enough for s'mores, and many of them are broken upon arrival. They do taste good though, as a sweet snack.","2186":"The peanuts were of average quality. They were large enough and salted properly, but they were hardly crisp. In my opinion, they are still better than those that you will find in a supermarket, but nothing really exciting.","2187":"Nothing spectacular here. Unlike the other reviewers, I found mine fairly salty. I think I'll try other brands before considering buying this again.","2188":"I have been receiving Peanut Shoppe of Williamsburg peanuts through the Subscribe and Save plan.  When I first ordered them, each can contained 12 ounces of product, but the most current shipment reduced the size of the product to 10.5 ounce cans and kept the price the same.  I think that is a bit misleading. If there is less product, why isn't it less expensive?","2189":"I wanted to like this cookie, it's very moist & chewy, has plenty of raisins & walnuts, but something about the flavor just doesn't appeal to my palate.  I'll stick to the ginger & peanut butter.  Like Pamela's other gluten free cookies, the texture is wonderful & can't detect that they are gluten free.","2190":"I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.","2191":"This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well.","2192":"I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.","2193":"What? This product is NOT what is showed in the photo. Instead of the box of Xtra Sour Goo which was shown, I recieved Monster Goo, which is NOT what I wanted to get. This company does not send you exactly what is in the photo, so watch out.","2194":"I was very excited to get this product as I used to love their toasted pumpkin seed oil. Unfortunately I couldn't taste the pistachio flavor. So because of the price & lack of taste, I wouldn't purchase it again.  Great company though. Michael is a great guy.  Michelle","2195":"I'm definitely in the minority with this opinion, but the vanilla flavor was not only too strong but it tasted artificial. (The ingredients list says \"natural and artificial flavors\" without specifically mentioning vanilla.)  This is not for someone who is looking for a tea accented with vanilla.  I am using 1 vanilla tea bag and 1 green tea bag which makes a more mellow brew, but I won't buy this again -- the Spiced Chai Decaf is so much better.","2196":"There was not as much flavor as I remembered from my previous purchase of this tea at the local grocery store.  Could not get it locally anymore and am wondering if product was discontinued and this was old merchandise.","2197":"Not as strong of a taste or smell like other teas.  Still good for a nice hot cup of tea","2198":"Not quite as good as advertised.  The chocolate flavor has a chemical taste and the coconut seems a bit off.","2199":"Short and sweet.....The product itself is top notch and my two GSD's love it. However, the last shipment looked like it was packaged by a three year old and thus it arrived via UPS with a can lid popped open spilling its contents over the other dented cans. Another case arrived seperately which was properly packaged using air pillows and was fine. Don't get sloppy Amazon. It will cost you customers.","2200":"When used right out of the can,and even mixed over dry food two of my dogs had loose stool. Right on the verge of being the runs. So I have too strain out the solids and get rid of most of the liquid. Even so they love the taste, too bad of the latter.","2201":"The batter seems to require more moisture than the instructions call for and they don't give a baking time, but 4 minutes seems to work about right. The waffles taste more like regular waffles than Belgian Waffles. I was hoping they would have a more \"malty\" flavor.","2202":"The ingredients have not been updated in the description, and are no longer accurate. The \"New Formula!\" is actually a cheaper formula.  Nutiva has replaced the Organic Fair Trade Certified Chocolate with \"organic chocolate flavor\". I'm not sure what \"organic chocolate flavor\" actually is, so I now make my own mix by combining <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0012C2GFM\">Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Hi Fiber, 3 Pound Bag<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001E5E0Y2\">Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder, Mayan Superfood, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)<\/a> and a little organic cane sugar.","2203":"Tastes good, but barely any protein. If you want protein, get Nutiva's unflavored 50% protein powder. You can flavor it yourself. It's cheaper and has more protein.","2204":"The shake is packed with goodness when it comes to fiber and it is only 80 calories per serving.The shake is filling. Plus the ingredients are certified as organic,which is a good thing. The only bad part is the taste. If you're looking for the smooth taste of milk chocolate or the sweet bitter taste of dark chocolate you won't find it in this shake. The best way I can describe the taste is \"earthy\".","2205":"Its  hard to find this Gyro Meat loaf. Once I found it I was instanly hungry for a Gyro Sandwich. I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!! Wow shipping was a little high. I figured it was due to the special shipping of meat. I think it took a little long and was not  to pleased with the shipping time. Over all the meat was great and I got my Gyro sandwich just  let down on the shipping.","2206":"The meat is good but it came packed in a thin plastic wrap and put in to styrofoam packing with little protection.  When delivered the plastic wrap was ripped and in direct contact with the packing material.  The Ice pack were melted.  It would be better if packed with at least two plastic barriers and dry Ice.  I ordered meat from Ohmaha meats and I came packed in a styrofoam cooler with dry ice and in good condition.","2207":"These are delicious crackers, but don't ship well, and many end up broken in the process.","2208":"I got these anchovies as a gift for my anchovy-loving boyfriend. While he liked them well enough, they were just too salty to be able to even consider getting through the entire can, even over months. We soaked them in water prior to consumption and that helped, but on the whole I think they would have been more enjoyable with about 1\/16th of the salt.","2209":"Used it for two months now.  Not sure it's helped at all.  My dog still thinks she's starving.  I had already cut her back, then cut her back more on recommendation from the product directions.  She loves the taste, but if she's lost even 2 pounds I'd be surprised.  Worse, though, is that it doesn't seem to stave off her hunger at all (that IS a tall order though, as she is one of those dogs who would eat until she explodes....).","2210":"This bouquet was delivered to rural western Michigan about 50 hours after ordered. The heavy, clear, tall vase tapers toward the bottom. Yellow and white carnations were beautiful, but the roses died before opening. The price couldn't be beat anywhere on line.","2211":"Hot and Spicy cheeze-its are yummy, but they do have a bit of a funny aftertaste, so you will need a drink.  Also like the other reviewer said, they were smaller packages than advertised.","2212":"I love the hot and spicy cheez-it But was disappointed to find the packages were only 1.5oz instead of the 1.92oz that Amazon advertised them as. Dont know how they managed to flub it up, it states right on the box 1.5oz.","2213":"the plant is pretty but they didn't gave me what i ask for. i ask for this plant in this picture and the send me another one with a darker color. what is not good is that once you open it you can not send it back. and also it was very small one. and the orchid is fake.","2214":"gave it to a friend as a gift and she enjoyed using it in her baking","2215":"Not as good as others that I've brought!~ Very Pricey and the bag does not seal that tight....I used a clip to keep it more air tight!~.......Not a fan!~","2216":"These are way better than rancid grocery story peanuts, but they weren't as good or as fresh as I'd hoped. I imagine that they'd been stored too long at amazon before being shipped.  Too bad, because if they're not going to be absolutely fresh, why would I buy these again?","2217":"I have tried numerous VA peanut tins...Royal Oak uses smaller peanuts and this batch was not as fresh as other brands...I will not be a repeat customer of this brand...they are in the C+ grade range.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001EQ5LT4\">Royal Oak Gourmet Virginia Salted Peanuts, 40-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)<\/a>","2218":"This is a nice alternative for Tiramisu if you can't have any dairy, but it doesn't come close to the \"real thing.\"  The flavor is similar to Tiramisu, but keep in mind that it is a \"cake,\" so the texture is nothing like the famous dessert.","2219":"Been searching for years for a better sauce than Pizza Quick.  Tried many other brands and end up going back there.  Pastorelli is thick and has a nice assertive tomato flavor but the pizza is fairly bitter and astringent.  I'm going to try mixing in a little sugar and wine next time.  The search for the perfect sauce goes on...","2220":"I LOVE these crackers.  They are great with everything. (Try them with a touch of pepper jelly and thin slice of Asiago) But when they come in tiny pieces, they are only good for soup!  Whatever this new packaging is, it isn't working.  My last order was ok.  What's up?  Who tests this packaging?  Sending them back is a pain in the patoot!","2221":"We like these crackers but the last two times we ordered them all the  crackers were smashed.","2222":"My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso. Now, we've gotten lazy and enjoy the Starbucks VIA italian roast instant coffee--the key to our appreciation being the strong but NOT BITTER flavor.","2223":"The supplier emailed me to check whether I wanted green or black berries which I thought was an impressive followup. The berries arrived in a plastic bag when I was expecting a glass container as per the advertising pitcure. However, all in all I was happy with the service and the product.","2224":"I received my 5lb bag of gummi's on time. They are good, but not the same gummi's you find in Germany. They look like it from the site. After I already ordered them I read another review that state's the same thing. I guess I need to fly to Germany for the real thing.","2225":"Okay, I admit it, I'm a red licorice junkie. But I don't care for Red Vines or Twizzlers; they just don't have the \"tooth\" I desire in a good whip. These spirals are very tasty (almost too good) and they offer a good, long chew. The one drawback is that they tend to be very oily thus the reason for my 3-star rating. Still the berry flavor is spot on. Just what I love about strawberry licorice. Warning: Having a 5 pound bag of licorice in the house will weaken even the mightiest willpower. You've had your caution.","2226":"I was disappointed... I expected the filling made from fresh apricots. And this one is made of DRIED apricots. Very big difference. I think the seller should make it clear what the product is.","2227":"Yes this is a good deal on coffee, but at least for this variety and roast I was kind of let down. I like a dark roast on coffee, French\/Full City\/Italian. When I opened up this bag I was pleased with the aroma and the oil on the bean. The brew itself was good, but I couldn't shake the burnt after taste, this kinda ruined the next cup for me.","2228":"Not a bad coffee but defiantly isn't as good as others. The Dark Brazilian is better in my opinion and the Italian Roast Espresso is the best of the Coffee Bean Direct line, if you love dark roast coffees.","2229":"While I may find other uses for these seeds I wanted them for sprouts. I soaked a couple tablespoons for 24 hours in my sprouter, rinsed twice daily, but after a week still only a few seeds have sprouted.","2230":"I like strong coffee; so when this came I made a pot and my husband and I tried it.  The coffee is ground fine and is bold in taste but not bitter.  Other than that I cannot say I would buy this coffee.  My husband liked it; I can take it or leave it.  Melitta has a good name and maybe if this coffee were brewed in a Melitta Coffee maker and filter; it might have a different flavor.  It was okay.","2231":"I like strong coffee.  I like starbucks.  I wanted to like this coffee, but found it not strong enough, even when I tried to double up on the brew strength.  Still, for a weaker tasting coffee, it was good.","2232":"I enjoyed this coffee for it's smooth flavor that wasn't extremely strong. It's definitely better than most brands you find in the grocery store. I would recommend this to someone interested in a solid cup of coffee.","2233":"I love good coffee but I hate a strong taste. This is perfect! It has an excellent smooth flavor and a wonderful aroma. Just writing this makes me crave a cup. Unfortunately the packaging is ridiculous and I won't deal with it again. It was impossible to open the bag by pulling the seal apart. I had to resort to cutting it open with scissors, which created sharp edges in the heavy foil. with better packaging, I would definitely rate this 5 stars.","2234":"This coffee was just so-so; nothing to write home about. I honestly couldn't distinguish it from one of the generic canister brands at the local grocery store.","2235":"This is good coffee, but nothing to write home about.  I like the grind, which is finer than most ground coffee, although I prefer grinding the beans myself.  It has a bold, but not bitter, taste.  Even though I'll stick to Eight O'Clock as my coffee of choice, this one certainly isn't objectionable and is better than most cups you'll get at the diner.  And it's certainly better than Folgers, MH, and other grocery store brands.","2236":"I was expecting a very high quality coffee but this wasn't quite it. It's a lot stronger than I was expecting due to the serving size printed on the label. It was pretty strong even for me and I like strong coffee.  However, I adjusted the amount of coffee and after a couple of tries I got a nice pot. It has good, but not great flavor. Definitely better than Folgers and the like but not top tier quality.  I recommend this to anyone looking for something a step up from Folgers.","2237":"Smooth rich coffee, comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions, I prefer with my coffee maker. Often I find, when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee, I find it too strong.  This was no exception. I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water, which would have been about 21-22 teaspoons. Slightly different, but harsher tasting.  All in all a good cup of coffee.","2238":"The coffee was ok. Not as strong as we normally like so I had to use a little more grounds but the flavor was ok then. The bag was one of those re-open bag but it would not open and when it finally did it tore a huge gash down the side. -1 star for each. Don't know if I will purchase again.","2239":"There's not much to review here. It's good coffee. It has a slight after-taste of flowers or sweetness, but it's otherwise an interesting medium blend of coffee. The package is a little hard to open (requires scissors), but the coffee itself tastes pretty decent.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a medium roast. `Well worth the money.","2240":"Good coffee. I guess I expected it to be very strong, \"European\", but it was pleasant. (Of course I didn't make it strong, either). The Vine package was 11-ounces, so the \"pack of 3\" is not understood by me. Again, good coffee, but I didn't find it to be especially \"outstanding\". My favorite coffee is still the \"Eight-O-Clock\" brand, and it costs a lot less.","2241":"This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks, i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware, this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds.","2242":"Stupid me - didn't read the label before buying.  I thought this would be pure xylitol, but later noticed they've added Dextrose with Maltodextrin and sucralose (Splenda) for extra sweetness.  I don't know what proportion of this product is xylitol.","2243":"I bought this box of crackers for a party at home but when I opened it, most of the crackers in the box were broken. Other reviewers seems to be getting only 50% broken but mine was more like 80-90% broken. Definitely not for serving.  Now, if you are not buying it for serving and just for your own munching, I'd definitely give it at least 4 stars. Great crunchy taste and the sea salt is just heavenly!","2244":"At first I thought I had wasted my money. I hated this coffee. It is very bitter. Then I had a great idea...use it for iced coffee.  I brew it for a medium cup. Fill a tall glass with ice. Fill glass 1\/3 full with milk. Add your favorite creamer. Add coffee and stir. So if you hate this coffee hot, try it cold.","2245":"Not bad, and perfectly drinkable, but bland with no liqueur. Not as bitter as some Columbians I have had, but that, unfortunately, goes back to the 'bland' bit.","2246":"I was glad to get the 3 boxes of Starbucks Coffee and it was ok. It may have been around for awhile as the coffee was good but didn't taste Fresh.","2247":"These are alright.  Def. have to rinse them the odor is not pleasant.  The texture is strange a little chewy. They are filling and need to be spiced up with something.  Not sure if I will buy again.","2248":"The cats do not seem to like the Ham baby food as well and the Turkey baby food or the Chicken baby food.  The kittens seem to feel the same way. = They really slurp down the turkey.","2249":"I love the idea of this product but with larger pills the beef pill pockets are much easier to mold around the pill than the chicken. Although my dogs love both flavors my boxer can easily eat the pill pocket and spit out the pill with the chicken flavor but does not do that with the beef flavor again because it is easier to bury the entire pill in the pocket using the beef.  They work great with smaller pills.","2250":"My doggies give me a hard time when I have to give them a pill. These work especially when I give them fish oil for their coats. I split the pockets as they are too expensive to use on a daily basis.  They love the flavor. They do not like cheese - go figure??","2251":"I actually have to break these in half and mold them around the pill for my dog to even eat these. I found that when he ate the whole thing (or swallowed it), he would end up vomiting it up in the end. He is 75lbs with a huge mouth so I don't know how smaller dogs would do with these. As for taste, he seemed to like this flavor the best in the beginning. Unfortunately he stopped eating them after I bought too many bags!","2252":"The pockets work good for holding the pills (i have several) but some of them fell apart - to help prevent it i put them into the refridgerator! Delivery was fast and effective.","2253":"I gave it a try because of the promotional discount.  The cookies were overpriced and arrived a little crumbled, but were good nonetheless.","2254":"pee-ew. you know sometimes when something smell bad you secret want smell more?  like fart. and sometimes bad smell is good smell. like musty man smell. this is stinky perfume smell for food. no flavor if you want to taste truffle.  I no recommend put on body people think you homeless.  Maybe if partner has truffle fetish then use on food and body.  bottle is cute. me big hands make bottle look like playtime barbie teacups.  I use for party once on salad and people think genius.  i use for mac n cheese.  so good my husband makes scent.","2255":"this freezer tray is not airtight --- so the puree will get freezer burn. I've had to enclose the tray in a plastic freezer bag before storing. I would expect it to work better for the price. However it is very easy to pop-out when ready to defrost.","2256":"if you freez baby food this is for you!!! very easy to get it out!!!! Gets the job done. Be careful washing it in the dishwasher the plastic top can change its form and after does not cover well.","2257":"The lid merely sits on the top, and is a huge pain to get on and off, especially since we use this to freeze milk. Half the time it spills everywhere while I'm moving it to the freezer. Sooo annoying but at least the bottom is silicon. It will be useful for baby food and less-liquid things.","2258":"Came to me with a chipped lid.  I wrote an email to the company to see what I could do and no one responded.","2259":"This was spicier than what I usually prefer.  Good change of pace in my salads, but I prefer the Broccoli sprouts.","2260":"This mix was OK and the price is reasonable, but there are a lot of unusable seeds in the bag that do not sprout - I'd say about 25%.","2261":"Crunchy.  Came packaged well.  If you are thinking they are going to be like FunYuns, you would be wrong.  They are VERY mild flavored.  They are ok, but nothing I would crave for sure.","2262":"I had originally bought these in medium for my golden retriever puppy. When she finished that box she had outgrown them so I bought the large.  While she loves these, she devours them in no time and her breath is no better. I do not think she fully digested them either. While she was a puppy they helped with puppy breath a lot because she ate them slowly, however I would not recommend these if you have a large dog that eats things quickly.","2263":"The product is great, but the shipping was alot. I want to order it again, but I won't because of the shipping.","2264":"Now that the Pounce Hairball Treats are discontinued, I needed to find a new way of hiding treats for my cat's twice-daily medicine. I was hoping that these would be pliable enough to wrap around the very small pill. Unfortunately, they crumble whenever any pressure is applied. The cat adores them, but I have to be very careful when giving her her meds now, and make sure she eats the pill, not just the treat.  Once these are gone, I'll be looking for something else.","2265":"I mean you get 2 bottles for a very affordable price!  Yes, it isn't the highest quality, but it is wonderful for the price. I add this oil to meats, lasagna's grounds etc. and it has added some great flavor. If you want more, then go for the much more expensive stuff (no guarantee it will be any better) or go for truffle pastes or other forms of truffles (which are much more pricey).  I am satisfied, though the packaging was not all that great, but my item arrived in good condition.","2266":"Great value for an infused truffle oil, however I enjoy the White Oil better for basically the same price.  I'm sure I'll use it all up and then just order that one instead next time.  They're both good.  Love it in mushroom quiche or garlic mashed  potatoes!","2267":"The tea was OK but had an odd \"flowery\" after-taste. I like teas that are more \"pungent\" so this one was not totally my preference - but, as I said, OK.","2268":"Strong oil smell is nice, but the flavor is a bit bland. I prefer the Bigelow. And no, I don't work for Bigelow. :)","2269":"I thought it was caffeinated. I was wrong. It put me out of energy for 20 days. Never again. BUT, the taste is good. A little strong though","2270":"Love Twinings Earl Grey in regular form, thought this would be a good choice for a cup of tea or 2 in the evening.  To be honest decaf tea is rarely satisfying, and this is the best of the options available.  Sorry Twinings, I love you I really do, its not you its me...decaf is not my cup of tea.","2271":"This is at best an average tea. It's not bad, just not great. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I tend to think the Keurig, while a great coffee maker, is not the best tea brewer.","2272":"I loved the Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey Decaf, but apparently it's discontinued and this has replaced it.  I don't like this nearly as much as the Celestial Seasonings.  Bah!  I feel betrayed.","2273":"I read the reviews of this dog food and everyone said their picky eating dog loved it. I have a miniature schnauzer who is 10 months old and he is a very picky eater! He was eating Nutro Max Lamb & Rice for puppies but started to show a little dis-interest in his food. I wanted to try something new and I chose this product. He did not like this food at all! I wouldn't buy it again, personally. The ingredients are good but my dog just didn't like it.","2274":"I was recently introduced to Genmai cha by a friend who's husband works for a company that does business with Japan.  I was at once intrigued and desirous to purchase more of the same.  However, I am still unable to find a similar tea with the same delicate taste.  Unfortunately, Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha is just adequate.  I am still on my quest to find that same delicate flavor I found in those tea bags my friend gave me.  Wish me luck in my search!","2275":"It is not real macha. I'm kinda disappointed with that. I expect that is green, but actually it is dark.","2276":"it was ok i thought it would be tastier i probably won't buy it again. it was very bland and didnt satisfy my taste buds","2277":"I like the convience of the McDougall soups.  This is not my favorite.  It seems to need bread with.  I use these soups for work.  Most of them are very filling and taste great.  This one taste really good.  But, I seem to be a little hungry.","2278":"Though not my favorite this is ok, great for those on diets where you need to limit Sodium, fat and etc. My recommendation though is you follow the instructions that were on a different flavor. After following the initial instructions instead of letting it sit after stirring, microwave at 20% power for an addt'l 5 mins. The flavors meld better and the pasta is a much better texture.","2279":"There's nothing really wrong with this soup. It's a little bland, and there isn't enough there to make it a meal. It would be okay for an afternoon snack, though. The beans and pasta DO soften up fine, if you follow the directions.","2280":"I use this lemon oil to add a few drops to my drinking water for a refreshing change.  The only thing I would like to see done differently is a packaging change, to put in a rubber seal with a drop-control feature, so I could add just a few drops instead of having to be careful not to pour too much in.","2281":"I would've thrown the whole bag out if not for my convection oven. My first microwave batch turned out HORRIBLE. 1\/2 cooked and no puffy\/fluffy pieces at all! I popped some onto my infrared NuWave oven and they puffed up after 8 mins. FINALLY- something edible and YUMMY! Glad they are healthier than the MSG\/other additive types of rinds, but kinda high maintenance as far as how to properly prepare them. I think I will try to find easier-to-prep ones...bummer.","2282":"Purchased this as an experiment to see what the effects would be.  Nothing happened.  Don't know if that's due to something specific about this company's product, or whether any sceletium tortuosum would have had no effect.  For the price it was worth experimenting, but a downer when nothing happens.","2283":"I was expected a lot better. i LOVE the beef jerkey nuggets they are so juicy n flavorful and delicious, but when i ordered these just to try them cause i couldnt find them in any store i wasnt too happy. when i tried them they were extremely greasy and not that much flavor.","2284":"I actually really love the Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets, however the 4 pack I received seemed to be old.  They weren't nearly as good as the ones I have purchased in gas stations.  Makes you wonder why that would be. These were tough and much drier then I expected. I have to say I will not order them again through the mail. If they had been fresher I would have rated them as I love them because I really do.","2285":"I don't eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice.  Bag is enormous for what's inside it.  There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.","2286":"They have a funky flavour and really get all over you fingers. I bought these to eat while driving it it isn't going to work.","2287":"We have 7 dogs. 6 of them wouldn't eat this, the 7th acted like it was the best thing ever.  the treats themselves look nice enough, small squares, sort of like cookies. bite sized for most dogs and didn't have any colors in them to run on the carpet or anything like that. So its really all about whether or not your dog likes lamb and barley. Hope that helps you","2288":"Normally when UPS drives up, my dog (mixed poodle, 20lb), goes nuts because he knows there's a good chance a package of goodies is being delivered.  If I tell him he's got a package, he'll happily and eagerly  open it himself.  This time, after a few sniffs, he couldn't care less.  He lost interest in the package right away.  I took two treats out for him and he just looked at them and walked away.  To be fair, he IS pretty picky.  Like all treats, some dogs will like them, some won't.","2289":"Let's face it- if your dog is anything like mine, s\/he'll eat anything. It's the same story here. Our dog gobbled these things up post-haste.  Thing is they're hard, brownish, unappetizing squares. In most cases they're actually stuck together into rectangles you need to break apart. and they're really hard to break apart. One square's pretty big for our little terrier, but the rectangles were HUGE. I tried to break 'em into squares- but couldn't even with a knife.  I gave up and handed the treat to our dog who was just happy to gnaw away.","2290":"I can't give these less than 3 stars because... well, dogs eat them.  However, be aware that these are another brand of extremely hard dog biscuit, while most dogs I have known seem to get most excited by softer (and stinkier) treats.  In fact, these might even be harder than the common milkbone stuff.  I can't comment on taste, but soft and stinky definitely get the biggest reactions.","2291":"My dogs love Newman's the Chicken and the Peanut Butter treats, but didn't care for these treats.  They are about 1.5 inch square and very difficult to break in two.  I felt they were too big and solid to give to the dogs.  After several attempts to entice them with the treats and no happy response, I tossed them.  I will stick to the other Newman's treats.","2292":"I have a sprightly Yorkie who will eat just about anything...except these treats. But he sure loves to play with them, hiding them in blankets or tossing them around chasing it. I keep them on hand as dog toys, but will likely not buy them again. I have given away extras to other dog owners to see if their dogs would like them.","2293":"It seems dogs are more like people than we think, give them healthy treat, they have no interest in them, give em the junkie ones filled with chemicals, they eat those....oh welll...","2294":"My dogs couldn't eat these treats. They were far too large and hard. However my neighbors dogs (a lab and boxer) loved them. Don't get these unless your dog has large strong teeth. Otherwise they seem like a good and healthy treat for your pet.","2295":"First time I gave these to my two little dogs (Maltese and Shih-Tzu), they chowed on these hard treats real nicely. The very next day, I noticed that they weren't really excited when I opened the package in front of them.  Keep in mind that these treats are really hard. I do not know about large breeds but my smaller pups definitely had trouble nibbling them.","2296":"I have a chihuahua and while he did take this and try to eat it, it was just too big for his little mouth.  The treats are too hard to break into pieces and he wasn't all that interested enough to chew the bigger pieces.  Though I will have to say my dog has never been the dog biscuit type so that could be part of the reason he didn't enjoy it.  It's a good quality product made from great ingredients, but not every dog is going to like it obviously.","2297":"Basket was smaller than anticipated for the price, bought it for a raffle and was disappointed. It also came in a different basket than was shown.","2298":"These crackers serve a purpose and have an okay taste although they are kind of bland.  I usually eat them with salami and cheese so the flavor from the other products helps.  These crackers are the best ones I've found on the market so will continue to buy them.  They also are closest to a Ritz cracker in size, shape, and crunch.  The other crackers I've tried leave an aftertaste and are paper thin.","2299":"These are the first gluten free crackers that I have ever tried, and they are alright if I have them with other stuff; however, I don't like eating them alone because there is a weird aftertaste. I think that I will probably either try a flavored variety or go back to my old fav rice crackers after I finish up what I have on hand...","2300":"The taste is great but most of the crackers are broken.  I am maybe getting 12 whole crackers per box.  The first time I ordered these there were several broken but this time there are more broken than whole.","2301":"I purchased these crackers from a local store for my 9 yr. old daughter who has celiac disease. She loves them but so many crackers were broken that they were mostly unusable for anything other than a bowl of pieces to snack on. I could only get about 3 cracker sandwiches out of the entire box. Glutino needs to fix this problem asap.","2302":"Great taste for a glutin-free alternative. Still have some of the symptoms w\/this as I do w\/foods made from wheat flour. :(","2303":"Even in the stores, they tend to be broken, but these on average are worse. Given the price per cracker, that makes them really expensive.  Love the crackers themselves. They are the best vehicle for peanut butter and jam that I've found.","2304":"These are the best glutin free ritz-like crackers...but that's not exactly a praise.  The cheese are not not bad, but the plain ones taste like egg.  A lot of gluten-free breads and crackers use egg as the lacking \"glue\"...and you can always taste it.  Yuck! All of that being said, the plain ones are ok when made into peanut butter sandwiches and all of the crackers are pretty good with a dip or chicken\/tuna salad...sigh.","2305":"these crackers are great, but the packaging is so poor that you are lucky if you get 5 crackers from one bag that are not broken!  I really wish this company would change their packaging, so that you would get whole crackers not broken ones.","2306":"I received my ordered and many of the peach gummis were stuck together and could not be picked apart.  I am not very happy as these were supposed to be favors for a birthday party.","2307":"I really like the product but this is the first and last time I'll order it. The box arrived with about 2 dozen of the single-serve containers busted ... a sticky mess to clean up. Don't expect multiple 24 container boxes like you see at the local store. It's 192 containers dumped in a cardboard box and sent on it's merry way to you. Good Luck!  12\/2011 Update: Amazon Customer Service remedied the situation. I provided International Delight with a few packaging suggestions too AND I have purchased more product with fingers crossed :)","2308":"Although I'm a big fan of International Delight's flavorful creamers,I must admit that I was unhappy with the condition the package arrived in. I received the box with at least 3 of the singles containers spilled in the box. Needless to say, the creamer carton was damaged and soaked(damp upon receipt). I also noticed that when opening the creamers for use, each single serving had a large number of tiny solidified cream pieces, which made me wonder whether they were still fresh.. Since they're still drinkable, I would give this item a little below average score...","2309":"Boutght both frech vanilla and the caramel macchiata(sp).  Not eh caramel cam in 6 boxes of 24.  The french vanilla came in a bag! Just a plastic bag! Some of them were busted and leaking probably from shipping. I don't understand why the caramel ones come in boxes of 24 but the french vanilla comes in a bag? *shrugs*  I like the flavor just didn't like the way they shipped it.","2310":"Excellent vanilla flavor. However I was not \"delighted\" that it curdled in hot coffee!!! Nasty and very unappetizing in appearance. I gave up using for hot coffee and use it for \"iced coffee\" with great results.","2311":"These are chocolatey with a touch of spice. Tasty but expensive, I imagine this is something you could make at home! But these are good overall.","2312":"I got this for Father's day and my dad loved it and did not mention one thing about it being small or anything. This really made his day so I am pleased with the idea to order the gift for him. I would recommend it!","2313":"The bonsai itself is fine.  You cannot immediately tell it's artificial.  It just looks like a healthy little tree.  That being said, I have pretty much an exact identical from a set of three I also purchased online here.  I could have bought another set of three with the money I paid for this one.  The picture used makes it look like a larger bonsai and is clearly not the one you receive.  Live and learn.","2314":"This is not really a high protein snack. Too bad I missed the link to the nutrional values - only 6 grams of protein. The other primal strips have 10 and are better textured. But if you can't have wheat, this one's mainly mushrooms. Also the free shipping takes forever and the prices have go up make them close to the store cost where I live.","2315":"The coffees are great, if you can get one that doesnt bust open while brewing and ruin your coffee! its good if you are looking for a bargain and dont mind making a second cup very once and a while, but if you use the keurig machine because you are a busy person, these coffees are not the right purchase for you. The flavor is though! just buy a normal sized package instead.","2316":"I like the flavor of coffee, but Emeril's doesn't have that traditional coffee flavor. It's pretty bitter--so much so, that 2 Splenda packets in a 16 oz cup don't mask the bitterness. Three stars because it's tolerable, but I'm holding out for tastier coffee.","2317":"Excellent coffee flavor - robust without being bitter.  I'd give this a five star rating were it not for the amount of grounds and sludge that are produced.  Don't drink the last quarter of your cup!","2318":"We're really enjoying our new coffee maker, trying different types of coffee. This one wasn't our favorite. We figured from Louisiana it would be stronger, but it wasn't. We're going to keep trying others, looking for a favorite.","2319":"Love the k-cup coffee maker and this strong coffee, but the k-cups from this order leak. The seal comes loose so coffee grounds come through around the edges, giving my coffee an extra undesired crunch.","2320":"Very good but not great. Did not have the richness and depth of flavor desired.  We ordered this and the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond and between the two the Green Mountain was better.  We had no issues with the Emeril's as far as grounds in the coffee, etc.  The flavor is good but for a French Roast, it has not overcome that K-cup issue of 'weakening' the richness of bold coffees.","2321":"Not the best nor the worst.  In the middle of the road.  Slightly bitter finish.  Bold brew smell but flavor is somewhat lacking.","2322":"I have ordered several different brands of coffee on Amazon.  This is a great coffee, but the box was short two units and there was one cup that was ripped and empty.","2323":"I like pretty much anything Emeril teaches or sells but this is not that strong and bold of a coffee and was hoping for a bit more BAM but it is pleasant and I will drink my 50 k-cups but probably go back to the Timothy's Double Black Diamond  or something with a bit more bump to it. Nice for after dinner but not a real waker upper","2324":"Not bad but I found it has more of a \"carob\" flavor than the rich chocolate taste of the Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie mix.  I am a chocolate-lover and this product was a disappointment to my taste buds.  I tried it because I love Pamela's baking mix.  I went back to the Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - far superior taste and texture.","2325":"These brownies had that 'off' taste that you sometimes get with GF baked goods.  I prefer the Bob's Red Mill mix.","2326":"Package arrived on time and in one piece, but after eating some I noticed the flavor of some is stronger than in others.  About 1 in 5 has no flavor and I end up spitting it out.  If they all tasted as good as the few good ones I would have given 5 stars.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.","2327":"My dogs love this product; however, it's too smelly and too expensive for me, their owner to purchase.  I'll take smelly or expensive, but not BOTH! CB","2328":"I was very excited to get this flour in the mail. The consistency is lovely. However, both my husband and I thought the coffee cake I had made with the flour had a funny aftertaste. I surely thought it couldn't be the flour. So I remade the coffeecake a few weeks later with a different flour and it was really good. I'm so sorry.","2329":"I am always looking for value and I buy in bulk.  This product is a great product with great taste, but the price is too much.  You are better shopping this item at a local grocery store.","2330":"pieces are small, not like a regular piece of jerky.  It had a good flavor though.  After purchasing them here, found them a lot cheaper at local warehouse store.","2331":"These cookies were better than the lemon ones, but still not as tasty as some of the other ones.","2332":"This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can.","2333":"The Galil Roasted Chestnuts are OK if you absolutely need a substitute for fresh chestnuts. I found that they were slightly mushy and didn't have the crunch of real chestnuts. I would use them again if, and only if, I couldn't get fresh and needed to make a specific recipe.","2334":"I sent this to relatives who are quite fond of this Wisconsin treat - as I am myself.  They said it was good, but I found the shipping cost too high.  The cheap price draws you in but the shipping is too much.","2335":"I do not have a green thumb.  Thankfully I'm great at feeding things, animals, children etc.  This plant arrived with minimal bud damage.  However once \"fed\",  she sprung back to life.  If you're squeemish around insects and worms, this is not for you.  If you enjoy nature at its best but live in suburbia, this offers a mini escape into the jungle :)","2336":"The plant dried up to nothing , it's dead ! I am trying every thing to bring it back. But no luck yet.","2337":"i guess its because i LOVE sugar that this particular item tasted only a little bit less than cardboard! YUK! sure, i will eat the entire 2 boxes i got for FREE but i wont be enjoying it though. these needed just a bit more sweetness, so i suppose i can always dip them in honey to get the flavour i want. other than that they have a lot of good stuff in them thats good for you, but i like what goes in my mouth to have some flavour to it as well","2338":"A nice blend of several different fruits. This stage 3 food was tasty. Not as thick as some other stage threes and there are no bites or chunks. It is more like a thin custard. My son always loved this.","2339":"I like supporting smaller family owned businesses and also the great prices on amazon but this syrup doesn't taste like maple at all to me. I might as well have bought generic corn-syrup based pancake syrup at the supermarket for $3. So I'll try a different brand next time.","2340":"This syrup is runny and I'm not used to it's taste. To be honest, it tastes like medicine to me. Maybe it's supposed to be this way, but I'm not used to it. I will recommend it to others who may be used to such taste and texture, but will try some other brands in the future.","2341":"The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto-shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.  Being opened enough to leak comprises quality, leaving it open to bacteria.","2342":"You can find similar grade maple syrup at Sams or Costco for much less.  The product is great (5*) but not happy with Amazon's pricing (1*).","2343":"I purchased the Maple Syrup on line due to the savings. We only use real Maple Syrup and if you stick to Grade A then the only consideration is the price.","2344":"I got this for my 12 year old cat who stopped eating his regular dry food, as the kibble was a little too hard for his teeth.  I ordered this because it was described as having soft kibble, but was just as hard and looked exactly the same as the Science Diet I had been feeding him.  He eagerly went for the food when presented, but stopped eating it after a few bites because it was too hard.  Luckily, I didn't buy a huge bag, as this food is expensive.","2345":"After a fairly decent experience with the grape version of this same candy, gave the lime flavor a go.  The flavor is fairly light and only a bit tart.  More like smarties than the intense sour flavor I'd have preferred.  Still, decent enough, and sugar free.","2346":"Great tasting, small in size like a \"Smarties\" candy. Made with Xylitol. But there's the fine powder from pulverized candy moving in the tin.","2347":"I'm used to eating crispy and crunchy cereal\/snack bars, so the Whenever bars were a surprise.  I still prefer a crunchy snack, but these are good for those who like their snacks soft.  They're not too dry, and many of the ingredients are organic.  You can see the chocolate chunks, but the overwhelming taste is coconut.  One family member said that she could taste the chocolate, and that it was moist--not like the dry bars.  It's not pretty, but it seems to be healthy.","2348":"These bars by Pamela's Products are OK.  They are very chewy and moist.  Also very stick-to-your-teeth.  However, taste is limited.  There is a general bland undertone, overall, but somewhat heavy on the oat flavor also with a bit of a coconut undertone.  There is no noticeable chocolate taste (to me).  However, the chips' soft slick variance from the other chewiness is obvious.  Bars (of any kind) can be very personal to folks in taste (like or dislike).  Try and see for yourself.","2349":"Soft cookie lump with a very light coconut and chocolate taste. I found the texture a little too soft and the taste on the bland side.  It was filling as a snack, but lack the I want more to my taste buds.","2350":"These bars have a very good, chewy texture that's enhanced by the chocolate chips. Since they only have 2 grams of protein in a 40 gram bar, I wouldn't consider them a meal replacement, but if you're looking for a gluten-free snack, these soft cookie bars might fit the bill.","2351":"It has an interesting texture that most people might find to be off-putting. Plus, as far as bars go, it is not all that filling. It also leaves your mouth feeling sort of chalky and full of oat kernels.","2352":"Yes, tasty -- but it takes a little getting used-to.  You have to like coconut to like this snack item.  That taste quite overwhelmed all else, for me.  I found few chocolate chips -- maybe they were all taking a rest when my snacks were baked.  Anyway, it's a chewy but tasty item worthy of your consideration.  Give it a try.","2353":"Pancakes are okay - nothing spectacular - doesn't make as many as box indicates (yeah I know weigh the mix not measure it but it is fluffy) but the thing that bothers me is the overwhelming vanilla smell - it isn't something I want in a pancake that I will be topping with real maple syrup","2354":"What I like about Assam tea is the specific flavor that distinguishes it from all other teas. High blood pressure forced me to try a decaffeinated version. I found the resulting tea disappointing: It lost a real lot of its flavor.","2355":"i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards","2356":"This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.","2357":"Mostly bought this tea assortment for the Chocolate Mint flavor, which has been disappointing. Has a fake chocolate taste. The only other flavors I've tried are Coconut Mango and White Peach. The White Peach is very good, while Coconut Mango is okay. I hope the other 3 flavors are better, otherwise I would say this 6-pack is a waste, which is a shame because I normally enjoy Stash teas.","2358":"I like the generous serving of real apples in this oatmeal. However, one packet does not have enough oatmeal for a hearty breakfast. Two packets at a time work best. Not very creamy, which was sort of a bummer, so you really need 2 packets.  but an ok instant cereal.","2359":"I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces\/chunks. I feel I was betrayed by the company. Hence I did not get what I paid for","2360":"Dogs love these things but `I do feel they are overpriced for the quantity you get.","2361":"This product is very expensive but my dogs love them. I can get them to do what ever I want as long as they know they are getting these as a reward but then again, I can also use cheap hot dogs with the same results. If you have money to burn, then buy this, if not, stick with store brand hot dogs cut up into small pieces.","2362":"I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.  The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.  The amount of product for the price is great! I would most likely purchase again.","2363":"This is more like a flavored spread than a true mayo replacement, I would not advise using it in Potato salad or tuna fish. It is very tasty as a veggie dip and as an admittedly rich burrito topping.","2364":"Bought this and the regular for a friend's birthday present. Purchased the 3 pack - My friend saw a review of this on Oprah - Can't find it in stores... so I tried this - It is a bit strong - had to mix in more light mayo with it... I am waiting for my tomatoes to come in for a Tomato and Baconnaise sandwich - that will be the TRUE TEST!! So far my review is this - Not bad -but it is strong. You may have to mix it with more mayo like I did.","2365":"We wanted the Baconnaise lite after seeing the product on Oprah. We looked forward eagerly to the  prospect of that great bacon taste. The decision in our house was 1 for and 1 not so. The taste is there, the \"greasy\" taste was also. I won't buy the product again.","2366":"I give this 3 stars because it wasn't unpleasant coffee.  It just didn't taste like anything.  It reminded me of hot water with those Folgers coffee bags dunked in it for a little bit.  I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again.","2367":"I ordered the Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend which I like as a smooth medium roast morning coffee.  I received the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend which is too mild for my liking.  Three stars for the coffee received. I won't order again from the Amazon marketing partner that sold it.","2368":"Does anyone know if K-Cups can be recycled?  I cannot seem to find out.  I would be much more likely to purchase a coffee machine that uses K-Cups if I knew the cups could be recycled.","2369":"I had many a k-cup but at 1.29 a piece. I'll just take my refill cup to the store and let someone else make me a cup. I have bought k cups on sale for as little as .54 a piece. Green mountain is one of the better coffees but lets be realistic with the price huh.","2370":"There ok have gone way up in price. Now that I have tried the Dunkin Donuts k-cups not sure if I will be going back to green mountain.","2371":"Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ... dumb on my part. My wife loves Nantucket Blend.  I mistakenly thought this was for 2 boxes of 24 k-cups because of the price. Much cheaper to pick this great product up at Kohls or Bed Bath and Beyond if you have access to them.","2372":"A matter of taste, I prefer darker, richer roasts. This one is lighter on the coffee aroma and flavor and heavy on the acidity. A true \"medium\" coffee, I would say.","2373":"NOT what I think of as Cincinnati chili. Seasonings weren't as spicy (meaning allspice, cinnamon, etc.)as the Cincinnati chili I've had there & I didn't think the chocolate added anything. But, if I were to rate it as just chili, I'd give it 4 stars. I ended up adding chili powder, cumin & a can of chopped green chilies & it was good. I did serve it over spaghetti with raw chopped onions & shredded cheddar \"Cincinnati 5-way\" style.","2374":"Generally the dog biscuits are great if not such a high percentage would be broken. The point in buying extra large biscuits is the \"extra large\", small pieces miss the reason for buying theme in the first place. There has to be a better way to pack the biscuits better than this.","2375":"Having lived in Okinawa for a number of years, I am a big fan of Okinawa's \"raw\" brown sugar (not to be confused with the brown sugar we know here in America).  This may be terrific sugar - however - it is NOT technically, organically, from Okinawa -- it is from Taiwan.","2376":"The product is fresh BUT I have bitten into a few nut shell fragments and this is unsatisfactory especially from a dental viewpoint.","2377":"Product is always excellent. It is very hard to find Packaging in any smaller sizes. still trying to find a Link for smaller and different quantities available.","2378":"I'd give this 5 stars if they'd leave the seasoning out of the can - I'm not going to eat 4 tablespoons of seasoning! So I don't want to pay for it (you're paying by the ounce) and I certainly don't want to sift through the seasoning to get all the little pieces out of it at the end. Overall - they taste excellent, they are very light & crunch & the seasoning does taste good, if only there wasn't so much of it.","2379":"Did not come super fast, packaged was smashed but the turtles inside were not damaged. Box was decorated for Christmas which perhaps the 'ad' for them said that, but I didnt' realize that since they were a birthday gift. Maybe I missed the fine print! Tasted fine, were a hit!","2380":"Not sure this was worth the effort.  Not the sellers fault - Just not worth the trouble.","2381":"If you enjoy the taste of Bacon, you may like these. If you're looking for the SW Ranch flavor indicated, expect Bacon flavor instead.  They have a nice crisp texture that's satisfying. I personally don't care for bacon flavored anything, so was disappointed to find South West Ranch flavor MIA. I tried & do like the plain sea-salt flavor.","2382":"Love these crackers.  They're very satisfying without being too salty or sweet.  Unfortunately a large number of crackers were broken in each package.  Based on the packaging.......crackers in a row in light cardstock box wrapped in cellophane.....it's probably not possible to ship without alot of breakage. For this reason, I probably won't order this item online again.","2383":"Got the Spicy Chicken from the grocery store. It was sitting right there, buried by Top Ramen and Maruchan. I wanted the Shin Noodle but was not there. The positive notes about this noodle bowl; Not too salty and the broth is worth drinking at the end. Cons; The noodles aren't that different from those other brands. For more then 3x the price, i was expecting better noodles. Also it's really not that spicy. Extremely mild, good spice level for kids.","2384":"I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them.","2385":"I used the full packet of seasoning mix and I though the broth had much more depth of flavor than most noodle cup type meals with distinguishable notes of lemongrass and ginger. I would rate the heat level at medium with a pleasant tingly mouth burn. Less salty but still plenty of sodium, there is plenty of broth so this would be a good one to use as a base with added vegetables and meat. Weak points are the dehydrated chicken and vegetables that have a distinctive dehydrated flavor.","2386":"Not a pudding by American standards.  But then again, the name itself is somewhat obscene by American standards.  I found this treat very very sweet, and it has been a long long time since I have seen bread in a can. It tasted much better heating in the microwave and then pouring some cream or half and half on top.  I give this out as a gift for Christmas and birthdays, and almost everyone loves it!!!  But don't give it to anyone at work or where there is an HR department - I learned the hard way.","2387":"If you find this stuff TOO delicious, and can't stop eating it, my suggestion is to read: \"The Voice in the Night\", a short-story by William Hope Hodgeson.  I can practically GUARANTEE you will NEVER want to eat Heinz Spotted Dick Sponge Pudding, 10 ounce can, pack of 6, (or any other size), after reading this story, ever in your life again!  Instead, have something healthy and wholesome - like Tuscan Milk!  : )","2388":"No idea what this tastes like, it's just a running gag with my family - someone gets one every year in their stocking for Christmas :). It kinda scares me.","2389":"If what you are looking for is raisins and peanuts, the Emerald Hartmony Raisinberry Nut trail mix is fine. There are plenty of good quality peanuts and raisins in each package (9 oz.). But don't buy this if you really want cranberries, almonds or cashews, because there are very few of these treats. The yogurt covered raisins are very sweet. My carton was delivered on a sunny September day and when I opened the psckage 90 minutes after taking the carton out of the sun, the yogurt raisins were still melted.","2390":"I've brewed this coffee a few times after buying a bag, and unfortunately it joins the many other decaf coffees that just don't have the full flavor of regular coffee. I'm giving it away and will keep on looking.  If anyone has tried a few decafs and found one that tastes great (brewed like most in a drip coffee maker), please let us know!","2391":"I purchased this plant as a gift for my husbands office; it looked more like the 'Charlie Brown Christmas Tree' than a bonsai tree.  Although I have to admit, it is alive and healthy.","2392":"Not my favorite - not because it's not very good but because it's not very good for very long.  An excellent chew if you just want or need a stick of gum for 5-10 minutes to clean your teeth after a meal.  Otherwise I'd recommend something else.","2393":"$30 for a 12 pack?  Are you serious?  Trader Joe's sells 4 packs for $3.  And that's about all they are worth.","2394":"Not bad, Not great, but good coffee. Put it on my list so if I can not get my first choice, I have a backup.","2395":"This is a very mild coffee.  I like the Green Mountain Coffee brand but if you are a coffee connosieur this is not for you.","2396":"The product was not in original packages, only individual Kcups loose in a box. Also, this was shown to ship as PRIME but took a week.","2397":"Smooth taste. Most certainly for lighter coffee drinkers. I prefer a stronger cup of coffee. But would order again to keep a variety around for guests.","2398":"I purchased this coffee for my teenage daughter in college.  She said it tasted OK but was weak compared to Starbucks.  She prefers a stronger coffee. It is really hard to tell the strenght of the coffe by the description.","2399":"I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.  I find myself brewing smaller cups of coffee, hoping for a stronger taste.  Next time, I'll go for a medium or dark roast.  I think it was the medium that I had before and I really liked it.","2400":"Tried this blend as a change from routine, but did not find it as enjoyable as I had hoped, still, it was good, just not great. Pat","2401":"Not too strong,not too weak.This is the coffee I buy my wife for her mornings.It is probably the simplest k cup brew,but sometimes that is all you might want.","2402":"didn't get ,quite the taste i wanted,brought thru amazon. but overall will still keep using this product,until it runs out.","2403":"I find that I have to use the seven ounce setting on my coffeemaker to brew this coffee, since it seems like a \" weak brew \" to us. I am going to try the extra bold for our next order.","2404":"Love green mountain coffee, but the breakfast blend was not strong or bold enough for me, will try stronger and bolder ones and get back to you all with another review, thanks","2405":"I expected a little more flavor as I usually like Green Mountain Coffees. Next time I'll look for a French Roast!","2406":"THIS FRUIT WAS GOOD, BUT VERY, VERY SWEET.  IT IS HOWEVER, VERY PRETTY LOOKING AND WOULD MAKE A NICE LITTLE HOSTESS GIFT, OR TO PUT IN A CANDY DISH FOR COMPANY.  FOR JUST SNACKING, I FELT IT WAS TOO SUGARY.","2407":"These are wheat thins, with some flavor added. The Flavor is very salty, and you can definitely taste the MSG that they added as a cheap way to spike the flavor. As far as i remember, you can't really taste the basil at all.","2408":"It's Okay but I must warn that the title is misleading. It should just be called Peach Tea, as I don't taste ginger at all. That was why I purchased it in the first place, for the ginger infusion. Joke is on me!","2409":"Tea is okay but it's more of a peach flavor than ginger peach. I couldn't taste\/smell the ginger at all.","2410":"They taste same as any other canned corn to me. Maybe I'm not taste sensitive enough, but can't understand why this is \"gourmet\". But 2 colored corns make dishes look more appealing, though!","2411":"I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas, usually I find them to be too sweet. Thankfully this wasn't overly sweet, but I still don't think it's something I would drink on a regular basis. I tend to prefer my fruit drinks to just be the fruit juice. I don't need the added carbonation added to the drink.","2412":"This Switch Kiwi Berry drink comes is as great, easy to handle, streamlined candy.  However, it does delivery an intense, fruit, flavor.  Great when you really need a sweet fruit recovery from a hot summer day.  Otherwise, a bit overpowering. A nice treat though.","2413":"If giving your kids, or yourself, carbonated juice gets them (or you) to drink more juice and less soda, that's good.  But the taste of this is similar to the juice in juice boxes.  It's a blend of juices with a fruit punch type of flavor.  It's also quite pricey.  Interesting once, but I won't be buying more.","2414":"I tried this after reviewing another Switch product (the black cherry flavor). The Kiwi Berry is also tasty, though for the life of me I couldn't taste the kiwi -- just strawberry.  The Kiwi Berry has the same problem as the Black Cherry, however; just SO much sugar! Ounce for ounce, it's as much sugar as in a regular, non-diet soda. I'd definitely drink any of the Switch products again ... but I won't try to convince myself it's a health drink!","2415":"A nice juice drink, but it just didn't grab me like other flavors did. I would probably not purchase it in the future, though I did not dislike it. Like I said, it just didn't grab me.","2416":"The Switch Kiwi Berry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a \"flavored water\" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn't taste too artificial.","2417":"You'll like it if you like sweet drinks.  Just a bit too sweet for me.  It has a strong flavor odor to it as well.  Doesn't really smell like strawberries or kiwi, but smells sweet.","2418":"It is not a bad drink. It tastes great but nothing like Kiwi Berry flavor. I can taste more of the apple or punch flavor. I like that it is all natural with no preservatives but I did not like the fact that it is very carbonated. I also like the fact that it does not have corn syrup or sugar that is in most other carbonated beverages.","2419":"I was not overly impressed with this entry into the 'natural' soda sweepstakes. The flavor was OK, but it was achingly sweet. I enjoyed the small size, since it would be a better alternative to younger folks.  But I would think twice because of the over-keening sweetnes.","2420":"This product is extremely sweet to the taste. The berry flavor is overwhelming to the senses.  Once you get used to the berry flavor (1\/2 way through the can). It becomes more calm to the taste buds and is less striking.  If you want a very sweet rare treat this will fit the bill. I could not drink this every day though.","2421":"If you are really thirsty this drink will be a welcomed choice, although almost anything would at that point.  However, I did not like this flavor as much as the Switch watermelon strawberry flavor which I found extremely refreshing.  The Kiwi Berry is also 100% juice. Although the drink is good, it has a strong syrupy berry flavor which reminded me a little bit of the Robitussin cough syrup I dislike. I also didn't taste any kiwi.  At 135 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly.","2422":"The flavor combination of kiwi, and strawberry is quite tasty.  With no sugar added, this gourmet soda keeps just the right amount of sweetness about itself.  Each can is only 8.5 Fl Oz (245 mL) - so in my mind it is rather pricey.","2423":"You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural. It's an all-natural strawberry flavored Fanta!","2424":"Switch kiwi berry is very sweet, heavily flavored (almost overpoweringly so), and is lightly carbonated.  My husband said it was good, he'd drink it if it was free, but he wouldn't go out to buy it.  I'd say the same.  It was okay.  I could taste a lot of grape flavoring that lingers along with a touch of apple.  I might even taste a tiny bit of kiwi, but I wouldn't describe the flavor as kiwi berry -- more like grape apple.  Switch is too syrupy for me.  I'd prefer something more light and crisp.","2425":"pros: 1) 100% juice 2) no corn syrup 3) no extra sugar added 4) gluten free  cons: 1) Cans are too small 2) Price way too high (probably because of the 100% juice) (you could get 24 cans of arizona ice tea at the grocery store for roughly the same price, and arizona cans are like 3x as big) 3) too sweet tasting, not that refreshing .  In conclusion, I probably wouldn't recommend it.","2426":"While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola, this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice, not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great!","2427":"This product is good. However, I feel the carbonation is a little more emphasised over the fruity flavor. Unless of course carbonation is really wanted. I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice. And the cost is ~50% more per ounce for Switch vs. Juicy Juice for my region.  I would say that for everyone who is interested in this product... let your taste buds be your guide.","2428":"tastes good, but a little on the sweet side.  may not be for everyone.","2429":"My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Black Cherry flavor).  I found the kiwi strawberry taste to not be very distinguishable (ie, without reading the can I would have jard a hard time guessing what the flavor was).  My husband thought this was better than the cherry flavor, as did the kids (ages 11 & 9).  We all found this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  I was not impressed with this drink and would not buy it again.","2430":"I decided to get this for my 7 yr old son to try to deter him from sugary drinks. Well this was pinkish and fizzy and looked nice, I took a sip and it kind of tasted like cough syrup lol...however HE LOVED IT. He wanted more...I did read the caloric content and ingredients and honestly it isnt any healthier than a soda! I will have to say that he did love it and I had ordered another flavor that he loved as well.","2431":"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either.  I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice.  The can design is pleasant to look at.  However, the Kiwi Berry flavor is a bit syrupy for my taste.  Also, at 135 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me.","2432":"I found the Switch Kiwi Berry Flavor to be good enough, but a little too sweet for my personal taste. I liked the fact that it was overly carbonated, and the amount in the can is just right, not too much to drink at one time. It makes portion control easy. Would I buy it instead of a soda? Maybe not.","2433":"I tried the cherry and Strawberry Kiwi.  Both are similar in taste.  This beverage tastes okay, nothing special.  It is quite sweet and can I say ... a little salty (not sure where's that from!)  It's like mixing concentrate fruit juice with club soda or carbonated Libey's Juicy Juice?  I would occasionally buy this product (because it doesn't taste bad at all) but I'll keep my fridge filled with Crush Orange soda for now...","2434":"This is a tasty drink with pale pink\/purplishcolor. With its carbonation one could call it a drink with bite. For me the taste was good but not outstanding. The aromatic bouquet of Switch is fabulous, but the actual taste, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to that mesmerizing scent.  The can's diminutive size lends itself to a quick refresher, not a slake for a heavy duty thirst. It's a good size for a pocket, lunch bag, or purse.","2435":"Pros: Tastes pretty good Slightly lower sugar than soda Vitamin C Carbonation adds a little pizzazz  Cons: Leans toward being too sweet (at least for me) Not significantly healthier 3\/4 size can compared to regular 12 oz drink  Bottom line: It's an okay but not great blending of the soda and juice worlds. Personally I would say stick with the real thing for more satisfaction. IE, if you're in the mood for a juice beverage, grab juice. Soda same thing.","2436":"Each of these Switch juice drinks seems to be about 50 percent sweeter than it needs to be. Imagine mixing Perrier, Kool-Aid and Mountain Dew together and you've got a good idea what to expect. OK, I know it's not that bad. But would somebody please tell my taste buds?","2437":"It tastes light and fizzy.  I liked the taste but would not 'switch' and buy this instead of my favorite juices\/pop.  If someone handed it to me, I wouldn't refuse it.","2438":"This drink is refreshing, but a little too sweet for me. I found that others in my household enjoyed it more than I did, so it might be more fair to give it a four star.","2439":"This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.  I enjoyed this flavor more because the sweetness was not overpowering and the carbonation remained light so I didn't feel like I wanted to drink a glass of water immediately after.  It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again.","2440":"Think kiddie juice box with a kick - plus surprisingly flavorful. That basically describes this interesting drink. The cans are 8.3ozs, slim and perfect for toting along. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives. This is definitely a good alternative for kids' lunch boxes. Flavor-wise, you definitely can taste the kiwi fruit and strawberry. Considering that most \"fruit\" drinks taste like syrup water, it was nice to have something actually NATURALLY flavored and carbonated so my kids' think they are getting \"soda\"when in reality they are getting something infinitely better.","2441":"Pleasant mixture of fruit tastes and the level of carbonation is refreshing.  However, I found--particularly in the initial tastes-- the drink to be too sweet. You may well enjoy it, though, since I prefer carbonated fruit drinks more on the citrus\/sour end.  The over-sweetness isn't accomplished with added sugar, or non-sugar additives; the sweetness comes from the apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the top two non-water ingredients.","2442":"The kiwi\/berry soda drink was tasty.  I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.  The effervescence was perfect....again, not so intense as the other sodas.  The cans are small(only 8.3 oz.), but adequate for a small thirst.  The idea of healthy 100% fruit juices combined with a slight carbonation is fine for children and adults alike.  Probably the only downside is the price per can compared to those very popular, but ultra-sugary or fake sugar colas and other canned soft drinks....but, you getting a far better product.","2443":"The Switch Kiwi Berry is very sweet, but tastes much better than the Orange Tangerine or the Black Cherry. It has a nice refreshing flavor though it's still not something I would buy.  Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:  1. Watermelon Strawberry 2. Kiwi Berry 3. Black Cherry 4. Orange Tangerine","2444":"Don't get me wrong, it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so. It is just big enough to quench your thirst before it gets warm.  But WOW, it was sweet. I mean, this is Kool-aid meets Grenadine syrup with some lemon-lime soda tossed in. So if you are looking for something like soda water with a slight flavor, just keep going. If you want a sweet drink to get rid of a craving, then this is for you!","2445":"It is a good concept to carbonate juice.  The kids loved it and called it \"soda\".  It has a nice flavor but it is difficult to taste the individual fruit juices though.","2446":"This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis.","2447":"I am not one with a 'sweet tooth' per se.  I didn't care for it but maybe someone who is hungering for something sweet would. It was just too sweet for me. I thought maybe my 10yr old would try it and he did not either! 34g of carbs and 135 calories in this 8oz can, I think I will stick with good old H2O.","2448":"Title says it all. There really is nothing special about this drink. It's virtually indisguishable from many other carbonated drinks out there. This drink is so average that I hardly even see a reason to write a review about it. I certainly couldn't see going to the trouble to order it over the Internet.","2449":"The kiwi\/berry combination makes this sweet and tart at the same time, with the carbonation adding a nice bit of fizz to keep the concoction light. That being said, this was a bit too sweet for my taste - but may be fine for people looking for the 100% juice experience, or those needing a sugar fix after a workout. Personally I'd mix this with sparkling soda water for a \"less is more\" effect, with cost savings as an added plus.","2450":"The Switch is apparently supposed to be a substitute for soda, with fizz but without corn syrup or added sugar, just juice.  However, the product, billed as \"Kiwi Berry\", has 135 calories in 8 ounces--more than one would get in soda--and is in fact mostly highly caloric apple and grape juice, for the sweetness, with kiwi and berries later in the ingredient list.  Yes, it is tasty, but a more healthy alternative would be club soda (or water, if you can do without the carbonation) with some juice added.","2451":"At around a buck a can, very expensive for 8.3 ounces of carbonated apple juice (with lesser amounts of grape juice, aceola whatever that is, raspberry juice, and finally actual strawberry and kiwi juice, plus some vitamin C added).  With the 100% juice banner all over that can, you might be led to believe it's 100% strawberry\/kiwi juice . . . it's not. Taste is not unlike a typical Strawberry soda pop, but not quite as good.  Expected sugar content (natural). 135 calories. I'm not likely to make future purchases of this one.","2452":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001LGGH40\">The Switch Kiwi Berry<\/a> does taste great but the problem is that it tastes nothing like Kiwi Or berry.  This flavor has more of a punch flavor is you ask me. The Apple, grape and other juices used in this - You can taste them to well and they over power the Kiwi Berry flavoring.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because it still tastes good, just nothing like kiwi berry","2453":"I like the idea behind this product, but the taste was just too sweet for me, and it has a strange aftertaste. While it has no added sugar or corn syrup, there are plenty of calories (135 for an 8.3 ounce can) and carbs. Also, looking at the price, I think it is way too expensive-almost a dollar a can. I would chose flavored seltzer over this any day.","2454":"This drink is nice and sweet with some carbonation but not as good as some of the competitors out there. BUT, it is made of real juice and that is a plus. My kids loved it!","2455":"This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes, but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor. They would be easily fooled into thinking they're are drinking soda. But for an adult it is overly sweet.","2456":"The order of three different plants arrived as advertised.  They were packed well.  Unfortunately, they didn't last a week. i contacted the seller and wrote him it was my first experience at growing plants and requested a refund.  He e-mailed and wrote he preferred to send replacements and asked questions, as well as, pointed out the plants go into hibernation around Sept. and last some months.  Over this weekend, i decided to scope out other plant sites. i decided no refund and no replacements. Lesson learned.","2457":"Weird black stuff inside the ravioli.  Otherwise, really tasty. My favorite, but the black stuff freaked me out. Not sure if it was bugs or what. I started slicing the raviolis open. I found a lot of them have black stuff.  I did an internet search to see if there was maybe an explanation. I found none. The ingredients are plain. I must have gotten contaminated cans or something.  Unbelievable how people think that reporting bugs in the food, or some kind of decontamination, isn't helpful. Some people are really lame. Well, enjoy eating your bugs, idiots.","2458":"I liked this flavor a lot when I had it with the pods that came with my machine...alas, the thrill is gone.  I am most definitely a dark roast fan, but this actually comes closer to bitter.  It can be diluted with some milk, but it's definitely one of those tastes that sticks with you until you brush your teeth.","2459":"Must be honest to say that I enjoy the Dolce Gusto \"milky\" coffees so much, that I'm a little bias towards the plain ones.  However, as a regular coffee, this is a pretty good blend.","2460":"I purchased this coffee as a replacement for Yuban dark roast - which is not available on Amazon, any more - and it is OK but not on par in quality with Yuban.","2461":"Was dissapointed with them.  Being a Cheetos fan, I thought these would be a treat.  First couple tasted pretty good but all-in-all, I'll stay with good ole Cheetos.","2462":"Dont know how to rate this. It shipped 2 days later than it said it would. Said I was suppose to get it by July 3. And I still havent gotten it. Im sure it will be good once I finally ever get it.","2463":"I like sticky rice and couldn't find it in local stores. This rice is nothing like the sticky rice in the restaurants. It's very small rice that is so sticky it clumps together in blobs.  It literally bonds to the utensils and dinnerware and is difficult to wash off.  Big Disappointment, will not buy it again.","2464":"I still like my jasmine rice that I can get out in town. We use rice all the time so I figured we would buy in bulk. Bad idea to buy online. Sooo much cheaper at your local grocery. Right after I purchased this item, my local store came out with bulk bags of my favorite jasmine rice, which is cheaper and much better quality than buying online. I have not yet been satisfied with a food purchase on amazon yet.","2465":"Organic coffee is actually good for you.  In moderation.  However, this one didn't set well with my finicky taste buds.  Ok for a trial.  Try Yuban Organic if you can find it.  It's probably just my strange tastes.","2466":"Blah... that's all I can even come up with. There's better organic out there I'm sure.","2467":"This cat food is adequate and nothing more. It will feed your cat. My cat does not like it and I am stuck with a big bag. This is a bargain brand, and gets the job done.","2468":"I'd eagerly awaited for delivery of this vanilla candy that I vividly remembered from childhood and was disappointed with this ersatz version of Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  It's not as rich and creamy in the mouth and doesn't have the real vanilla flavor that I recall in the original.  I would bet that the ingredients are not the same; for one thing soy is now used.","2469":"These bars are just the right balance between the flavor of the coconut & the sweetness of the rice syrup. Unfortunately, although the expiration date is in 2013, about a third of mine went bad, or perhaps started life that way. They had a funny, metallic taste, & one even had some black substance on it, which may or may not have been mold. I'm wondering if refrigerating would have prevented this. I highly recommend these bars, but beware of the keeping quality!","2470":"These bars are all natural and taste so good. And if your on a Weight Watchers diet, these bars are worth 5 points. The only down side is that arrive in the mail melted. I wish the seller would pack these in ice so they arrive in tact but that might be a dumb idea.","2471":"One packet is only good for 6 cups, not a full pot as the directions state. If you put in any more water, the coffe is too weak.","2472":"I followed the recipe exactly. After freezing them, I have to admit, I used a butter knife to try to cut it and I BROKE the KNIFE!  Ha!  Nonetheless, they were yummy!","2473":"I have tried several gluten-free brownie mixes.  Pamela's brownie mix is a lot better than this one.  I found this to be a little bitter.","2474":"These were the BEST brownies and then the company was sold. Cheaper ingredients make for lesser brownies. I am ticked off that we celiacs, etc are paying BIG $$ for a product that is now being mass-produced and with lower quality ingredients. Shame on you. They are still good..not great.","2475":"These are tasty enough.  Indeed, if you mix in a tablespoon of raspberry jam or a half-teaspoon of cinnamon, these are QUITE tasty.  But they have no cohesion.  We try to cut them, and they crumble in the pan.  I know gluten-free baked goods tend to be more crumbly than the conventional stuff, but we made Betty Crocker, and they held together just fine.  As tasty as these are, I can't arrange them on a platter and serve them to my friends.  So I'll stick with Betty for a while, but thanks anyway.","2476":"Works very well, but I found the same product at walmart for 5 bucks, quality good, price not so much","2477":"The mat is OK since it does not cost much.  However, I did NOT want blue.  It was supposed to be Silver.  It does not match my room.  Maybe some people don't mind that but I was a little upset when I opened the package and it was blue. I probably would not have bought it.","2478":"there were grinds floating in my coffee every time I used one of these pods.  Did not seem to have that with other brands","2479":"I have yet to find a favorite coffee for Keurig Brewers.  Seems none of them are strong and flavorful enough.  This is good\/okay, but I am still left wishing for a better option.","2480":"A bold, but not a super bold blend. This coffee has a bitter edge and a bit of an acidic aftertaste, so it is not one of my favorite k-cups.  For bold (not hair-raising bold), I prefer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001D0GVA4\">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)<\/a> (a favorite) or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003VXFL1Q\">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, French Roast (Dark Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)<\/a>, both of which have a smoother finish and better flavor.","2481":"This is great coffee and I have been ordering it.  You can get a much better deal on this at Sam's Club.  $36 for 80 cups.","2482":"I like my coffee strong, and Newman's Own Special Blend is that, however, I'm not crazy about the slight bitter taste. Smooth and strong would be better, so maybe next time I'll look for something along those lines....","2483":"A box of these was included with my new Keurig system. I fear and detest weak coffee, but a 10oz serving of this is still strong, with a satisfying body to it. Another positive is that it's not sour, like I found the Kona to be, nor it is especially bitter. But, though I'm fine with dark or French-roasted coffees, the Newmans Own Special Blend tastes flat-out burnt to me. Next job is to try a sampler pack to find my perfect K-cup.","2484":"I bought this one for the picture on the front. I thought it might reinforce my threats to send my naughty children to grammas if they don't behave.","2485":"I have been drinking the tea for about a year now. The product is fine. My complaint is with the recent change on the individual tea bag envelope. The new lavendar colored envelopes are impossible to open without the aid of scissors (or my teeth). The previous two-tone envelopes tore open easily. Please revert back.","2486":"We've purchased dragonwell green tea from other vendors and the quality has been much better.  Of course we paid quite a bit more for it as well.  This just goes to prove \"you get what you pay for\". This bag has a lot of stems and other debris, so would not recommend.  Pay the higher price and get the better quality tea.","2487":"It smells good, tastes like black tea, and it is decaffeinated.  I didn't really taste the creamy sweet flavor of vanilla.  In other words, the tea tastes like normal black tea if not for the vanilla aroma.  I think I'll go back to green tea based tea.","2488":"Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies has my vote for the best cookies on the plannet.  Problem was in the shipping\/packaging, since in the 4 packs I've opened, I can count on 2 hands the number of whole (unbroken) cookies I've gotten. Most of the cookies are in pieces as big as or smaller than a quarter.  I'd think twice about ordering cookies via the net.","2489":"I purchased this in high hopes of an organic replacement for the quadratini wafers that we absolutely love but they fell short. They wafers aren't crispy they're thicker and quite hard like a thin piece of plywood(i wish i was joking) I would have given them less but after i smothered one of the wafers with peanut butter it tasted kind of like a Peanutty Buddy but after buying these over a month ago, they still sit in my cupboard (and i have 7 kids :-( and I wont even go there with the vanilla...","2490":"Not a very cost effective sweetener, takes too much to do the job.  I believe that truvia (a combination of erythritol and stevia extract) is much more likable and costs less to use.  We didn't mind the taste as some others did, but were glad we only bought one pound.","2491":"This is advertised as a powder...which it is not. When you get the package and you read the smaller print it says crystalline powder. AKA, it's small crystals. When I think powdered I thought of the consistency of actual powdered sugar, light and fluffy...not crystals. I had a hard time getting it to dissolve and while it tastes good and just like sugar I just was disappointed with the \"powder\" label. So if you're looking for a sugar substitute, get this. Tastes good. Looking for powder, don't get this.","2492":"It's a decent product if you can't handle\/tollerate Xylitol and some of the side effects people experience. Erythritol, IMO, is not as sweet as Xylitol and is more expensive. I gave it a try, but will stick with my first choice.","2493":"This product is not very sweet.  I also use Agava nectar and find that sweeter.  I was looking for something to take the place of granular sugar.  Don't think this is it right now.  I'll stick with the agava nectar.  Trying to get away from nutra sweet, sweetn low and splenda.","2494":"The product is advertised as \"100 Pure Erythritol Crystalline Powder.\"  The emphasis should be on the crystalline, not the powder; the texture is like granulated sugar, not powdered sugar, and this can make a difference when cooking.","2495":"It is OK.  No need to spend money on expensive mints!  It is better to brush one's teeth or chew a Big Red Cinnamon gum.","2496":"Man! I tried this stuff and it's delicious. However, it has palm oil in it. Not only is palm oil extremely unhealthy, it contributes to the clearcutting of rainforests (See Rainforest Action Network for more info). I am personally committed to NOT buying items with palm oil, so I'm going to try a different brand!","2497":"This is the 3rd brand of Mexican Spiced hot cocoa that I've ordered.  This by far is the poorest in tasting.  The other 2 were far superior in flavor.","2498":"I think the concept of this item is great. I have only eaten mixed with water and it's just okay. I don't like that sugar has been added since I only use natural PB that needs to be stirred w\/ no extra oils etc. I like PB but am not a 'nut' about it. Perhaps this will taste better mixed with other items so I'll try but since I don't eat lots to begin with, it's not a product I'll repurchase.","2499":"At first it is not so hot but.... it grows on you.  I added a very tiny amount of honey in warm water to mix, dash of salt too.  like it so much I made up the entire jar like that and kept it ready in refrig .  I put it on apple slices as a pm snack or mid morning break.  Spreads nicely on an apple, unlike real PB.  Love not getting all those calories.","2500":"I found the taste to be satisfactory, especially for the reduction in calories.  I didn't mix it right the first time I had to end up making double, which I ate of course.  Ultimately, I decided that I really like crunchy peanut butter the best.  However, my belly will welcome the PB2 just fine.","2501":"Consider buying this from Bell Plantations it's much cheaper, about $3.99 a jar.  Amazon is riping people off with this product, shame on them!","2502":"Not good on sandwiches or oatmeal. Good for cooling with.  Don't know if I would buy it again, bit it certainly was interesting.","2503":"PB is a major source of calories, so this is a pretty great idea. However, it's honestly just too expensive to purchase as a regular replacement for peanut butter. The taste is just OK: when mixed with water, it tastes vaguely like peanut butter, but it's tough to get a very similar texture. Mixed in protein shakes, though, it's absolutely great. I would buy it exclusively for that purpose if the price were a bit more reasonable.","2504":"It's a good tasting peanut butter when mixed by a 1:1 ratio with water (sometimes added a bit of Truvia to make it sweeter) but didn't provide nearly as many servings as it says it will. i probably only got 9 out of it.","2505":"The pricing is way off.  The description says that it is a savings over the $14.95 retail price, but that is the price of 4 jars at Bell Plantation's website, not just one like on Amazon.  I will be buying this somewhere else.","2506":"I was anxious to try this lower calorie version of one of my favorite foods. Overall, texture is fine, but taste is bland and seems to lack depth of real peanut butter. I would use this in recipes, but was sad to say it wasn't my favorite and I would eat regular peanut butter instead.","2507":"I really like the taste of this powder.  It is great in a protein shake, especially with 1\/2 banana blended in.  My issue is with the shelf life of the product.  A 6.5 oz container lasts a long time, but the container that I purchased from Amazon expired in less than a month from the purchase date.  I noticed that the date of production was exactly a year ago.  Most protein powders have a shelf life of a couple of years.","2508":"Let's be honest. Nothing will compare to real peanut butter - more specifically, Smuckers All Natural (creamy or crunchy, they both go down smooth). I'll crush a 26oz jar in a week, so obviously I needed a better alternative. Definitely still has a peanuty taste, but... something is missing. I'd still recommend this to anyone who is curious about it. I need to try some of the recipes they have on their website.","2509":"I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.  However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.  I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.","2510":"This product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself.  However, as others have noted, Amazon has WAY overpriced it.  The manufacturer has its own website where it is much, much cheaper.","2511":"The product gets 5 stars.... Great taste, less fat, easy to throw into smoothies, turn into peanut dressing, for thai food or satay like dishes.  Amazon pricing gets 1 star. This is available in grocery stores for less than $3.00, so why Amazon charges this pricing is obscene to say the least!  Pick this up from your local grocery store, or get cheaper price from plantationbell.com or netrition.com","2512":"PB2 turned out to be a pretty good alternative to peanut butter. Although its definitely not as sweet it still tastes good on PB and jelly sandwiches and overall I thought it was pretty good. Its no Jiff, but if you are trying to cut back on calories it's a great substitute.","2513":"I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that.","2514":"Grapes are very sweet.  Adding more Grape Juice Concentrate to sweeten the juice is overdoing it.  I wished Kedem would stop making a good product bad.","2515":"This is a good tea, for an incredible price.  However, unless you drink tea on a daily basis, it is probably not what you're looking for.  It comes in a very large quantity that will not stay fresh forever.  That said, I brew kombucha in five gallon batches.  This tea makes an excellent kombucha, and I use it quickly enough to justify the quantity.","2516":"As others have mentioned, the taste is pretty bland. But it's cheap and if you put twice as much tea in it tastes almost as strong as fancier, more expensive brands. Almost.","2517":"I decided to try this tea based on the description and reviews, but found it weak, with little flavor. For reference, I like my tea very strong and normally buy the Davidsonas English breakfast tea.","2518":"Perhaps just this batch... not a flavorful tea.  A milquetoast quality.  I like a robust tea so this may be my own misunderstanding of how this blend is supposed to taste.  I'm glad I tried it.","2519":"I love the licorice tea so I thought I would love this too.  But the mint is too strong and you don't really get the licorice flavor.  I'll stick to the Egyptian Licorice instead.","2520":"The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.","2521":"The gift looks much cheaper when it arrives in the mail. The picture listed on Amazon makes the basket look very classy. It is still a nice gift for someone that needs sugar-free snack items. I just think that you might be able to find a better bargain somewhere else.","2522":"I use to buy this all the time with no problems. I had brought other soil that didn't compare to the quality of this one but the last go 'round of pots I soiled are infested with gnats. An extreme amount. Its spread to my other plants and the soap water trick is not working.  I'll have to buy bug spray for house plants now. Try something else.","2523":"I purchased this in high hopes of an organic replacement for the quadratini wafers that we absolutely love but they fell short. They wafers aren't crispy they're thicker and quite hard like a thin piece of plywood(i wish i was joking) I would have given them less but after i smothered one of the wafers with peanut butter it tasted kind of like a Peanutty Buddy but after buying these over a month ago, they still sit in my cupboard (and i have 7 kids :-( and I wont even go there with the vanilla...","2524":"I wish the ingredients were listed in the description before I'd spent my money.  Here are the ingredients: Potato, Vegetable Oil (contains one or more of the following: Palm and\/or Canola), Sugar, Soy Sauce Powder, Seafood Extract (Spicy Cod Roe Powder, Bonito Extract), Flavor Enhancer (Monosodium Glutamate, Disodium Ribonucleotides), Seaweed, Salt, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Anticaking Agent (Calcium Carbonate, Tricalcium Orthophosphate, Silicon Dioxide), Vegetable Extract (Shiitake Mushroom), Corn, Sugarcane), Sea Tangle Powder, Red Pepper and Natural and Artificial Flavor. Product of Hong Kong.","2525":"These treats are VERY large, even after breaking into the three pieces that are scored.  Too large for small dogs (maltese, pomeranians) .  They can be cut into even smaller pieces but it is not real convenient to do so.  Dogs do love them however.  Would be great if smaller sizes were available.","2526":"sparkles are ok - but melt into the frosting and don't show up as nicely as they should, container was 1\/3 empty. Packaged nicely, shipped on time, just was disappointed iwth the product itself.","2527":"My twins love this!! BUT Walmart sells them for $1\/ for a 2pack!  Worth going there to save the extra $!","2528":"Tried this food for my adult mix that has been on a fish based diet since puppydom. I thought trout and sweet potato would be an interesting change from salmon, but nope, not really. It gets eaten, though not with any particular excitement. I think it is safe to say while my dog is indifferent to it, the ingredients and price are a plus. Spruce it up a drizzle of olive or canola oil and it gets eaten.","2529":"I am a big fan of Jem and I love the way it is so spreadable. This is the first time I tried the Coconut Cardamom flavor and I loved the flavor, but after the first use and I put it in the fridge, it was hard as rock and not spreadable at all. Flavor was fantastic and I did not have the problem with the Cinnamon Maca flavor - it spread like a dream down to the last drop.","2530":"Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end-of-the-2009-year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010. Somewhat short of my expectations; all the more so, expiration dates are clearly written on the boxes and, I am sure, processing staff could easily note this.","2531":"The flavor of the tea is strong and smooth, and a flavor that you would expect in a good English Breakfast Tea.  My only complaint is that the tea is ground very finely, and the tea caddy doesn't keep tea particles from getting into the tea, and some are fine enough to even pass through a tight strainer.  The Assam of London loose tea that Amazon carries is much better.","2532":"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!","2533":"My dogs love these treats but to tell you the truth I can't tell if they are helping their arthritis or not.","2534":"I bought this product because of the convenience to take anywhere. Price is great, but the taste was pretty bland. I was definitely full after eating this, but the taste wasn't what I expected. Try for yourself!","2535":"OK, I give up - what's the point of putting TWO servings in these cups?! Doesn't that defeat the purpose of them? What are you supposed to do with the second helping - save it, or store it, or eat it, or throw it away? Anyway, the taste is fine (thought still sweet) - but what's with the \"new bigger size\"??! Who needs it?","2536":"I thoroughly enjoy the Celsius Energy drinks.  My problem is with my last two shipments.  Both times, cans have been mangled and this last time to the point that one of the cans had opened.  You really need to reconsider your packaging or I will reconsider my future orders.","2537":"When my local grocery store stopped carrying my favorite avacado oil I started a search for a new favorite. I typically use it to make homemade mayo so I prefer a mild creamy flavor. This is far from mild or creamy. It gave my mayo a pungent almost bitter taste the was more like olive oil than avocado oil. In the past, quality oils have turned my mayo slightly greeninsh, this stuff turned it an odd bright yellow which does make me doubt the quality of the product.","2538":"Tastes good, but according to most websites that I have read, avocado oil is SUPPOSED to have a HIGH smoke point...like over 500\u00b0!!! But, when you visit THIS manufacturers website, it lists their oil as having a smoke point of just 350\u00b0. I have written the manufacturer, I will post an update soon. This is puzzling to say the least.","2539":"The oil seems to be of good quality, but when I received the package, one of the cans was so badly dented that I just threw it away. There were plenty of airbags packed around the cans and the box wasn't dented or creased, so I think one of the cans was already dented before it was shipped. When a can is dented, heavy metal leaches into the product. I feel a bit cheated.","2540":"Odd tasting, boarding on rancid. I am not sure if this was just a bad batch? I do not care for it... I had avocado oil before, but it tasted noting like this.","2541":"I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang)","2542":"I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.","2543":"Warning - this tea is packaged in the US, and not the UK.  Hence, it is weak and tasteless compared to the British equivalent.  Very disappointing.","2544":"These chips are not bad to taste, but a little more money than I would pay for 1 bag of \"healthy\" chips.","2545":"Contains triple filtered carbonated water, erythritol and stevia ,(not cane sugar,as stated on product description) jamaican ginger, south african ginger root and west indian pimental.It has a slightly strong  sweetened flavor (might be the erythritol)that could be offensive to some.It is a distinctive taste but not for all I suspect.Zevia is better in this flavor, imo,but i would rate this a good thirst  quenching diet ginger ale.Your move.","2546":"If you zoom in on the bottom left of the box there is a list of ants this product does not work on. Too bad this info is not in the web description. It may be fine for every other kind of ant, but I almost wasted my money.","2547":"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery, Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size","2548":"I bought kelp to enrich my diet with iodine, hoping to substitute it for salt. I find it crunchy, with an not altogether pleasing taste.  It's not on top of my list of recommendations.","2549":"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery, Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size","2550":"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery, Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size","2551":"My wife bought these and was trying to find an alternative sweetener in a soda.  We are not going to buy them again... sorry.  Other's may like the soda, not us.","2552":"Firm olives but a little too salty for my taste.  I know these olives are supposed to be salty but they should not be a salt lick.  Good when eaten with other food.","2553":"I like the product and the promptness of getting it. Shipping cost much to high,will not order from them again.ridiculous","2554":"The product is described as \"bold\" and that is accurate. We found that the high level of bergamot oil overwhelmed the flavor of the tea rather than enhancing it as other Earl Grey's we've tried. We are blending it with other teas to produce the milder bergamot we prefer.","2555":"This tea has an interesting scent in the can.  It's like bergamot overlaid with jasmine or some other unusual flower.  As a brewed tea it's all right but sniffing the dry tea was unpleasant.  I think we will stick with Republic of Tea or Yorkshire Gold.","2556":"Had to get a tea ball for the loose tea.  This is for a true tea afficianado who can appreciate the art of making tea.  Clearly, this tea being organic, the tin being so decorative, and the purchase putatively benefiting a specific tea growing region allows certain tea afficianados to have a mental appreciation for the background of the tea while drinking it. I drink Earl Grey as a pick me up in the afternoon.  This one is comparable in taste to other Earl Greys on the market.","2557":"I have had many different versions of Earl Grey tea and I am a fan, so when I read such raving reviews as this tea has received I had to try it. I now have three canisters of this Rishi version of Earl Grey and perhaps I will be more impressed by the second or third canister; so far however, I am not impressed. As I suspect, perhaps I received a stale batch, but the product I have been drinking is definitely not superior to Trader Joe's \"Earl Grey Tea\" bags in terms of strength or flavor.","2558":"Its a nice system. If you like lattes or machiatto this can deliver them where the Nespresso can't. The price here is way more than the Nescafe web site price though. These things are $9.49 a pack, how can anyone try to sell them for $40 for three?","2559":"This coffee is fair, but it seems like a waste of money and the machine.  In my opinion if you're wasting your Dolce Gusto if this is all you use it for.  I'd prefer to make a regular pot of coffee but it is easy to make.  Cost-wise your looking at 50+ cents a cup not to mention the machine cost.  I won't be ordering any more, I'll stick with the Cappuccino.","2560":"Dolce Gusto's Caffee Lungo is their version of plain Ol' Coffee. It is pretty weak flavor, so I didn't really like it--No where near bold enough, lacks flavor. My dad, loved it. So when I need instant coffee, I will be reaching for the espresso pods instead and just pulling 6 ounces (Americano-ish).  So while Dolce Gusto will likely replace most of the useage of my espresso machine, I doubt it will make much of a dent in my drip coffee pot's usage, as Caffe Lungo just doesn't measure up.","2561":"My husband admittedly likes mild coffee.  He found this too strong and bitter, but said that some people like it that way.  He will try the mild version next, but said it also tasted like instant coffee.  He poured it out and made a pot of his favorite donut house blend.","2562":"As with many of the flavors we have tried, this one falls into the middle of the road.  We do not drink more than a cup of coffee in a given day, but some of us do like frou-frou coffee now and then.  However, this is not really that type of coffee. I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer\/milk, so I am probably a little more biased.  I think this flavor suits my basic taste range for coffee overall, although I've tasted better.","2563":"Out of the 5 flavors I tried with the Dolce Gusto machine, this one is definitely the weak link. I did not enjoy the flavor at all - it sort of tasted like stale coffee that sat out for several hours, but was still hot.  I tried playing a barista and adjusting coffee levels, but it came out bad every time. A very disappointing flavor, and one that I will not use again. Also, I've noticed that these Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffees have a pretty short shelf life, some shorter than others. So stocking up is not an option.","2564":"I like them in stews.I need to work on frying them cut up;Any suggestions?I always wind up throwing fresh (used to be) potatoes out because I don't use them fast enough.Any tips?","2565":"I was probably expecting that real mincemeat pie taste I got many years ago from my great-grandmother's homemade mincemeat pies.  This is not it.  While it doesn't taste bad, there is some off flavor, almost like you can taste vinegar in it.  And one of the spices is overwhelming.  I won't throw them out, but I would never purchase them again.","2566":"My order did not include boba straws.  The shipper either forgot to put straws in my order, or this picture is misleading.  Otherwise, the tea was delicious, and the boba was easy to make and delicious!","2567":"I do not like the consistancy or flavor of this product. Its price is near double that of sunflower butter which I also purchased to replace regular peanut butter. We love Sunbutter!","2568":"This is an effective product for producing milk however my 2 month old wasnt getting full from my milk because it produces an abundance of foremilk which is watery and not enough hindmilk which is the creamy stuff. Also my son got diaper rash and was gassy.","2569":"Some of the packages were fine and the cotton candy was good.  In other packages, the cotton candy was a solid mass and was inedible.  There was no apparent damage to the packages with the bad cotton candy.  This was very disappointing.","2570":"the blue and pink candy are all meshed together, but it is cotton candy. I used the packages in my kids lunch on friday's as a treat now.","2571":"This is a pleasant enough White Tea but I don't taste Pear at all!  Which of course is disappointing considering I bought a flavored White Tea and not a plain one.  Won't buy again.  Prefer the CS Perfectly Pear instead.","2572":"I ordered the basket based on the picture that showed the Keebler branded packages of cookies but when it arrived it was the Murray's sugar free cookies instead (the Rugers cookies were also in the basket as described). I contacted the seller who told me that they are made by the same company. However, I was looking for something different and if the photo had shown the Murray's packaging I would not have purchased it.","2573":"This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.  We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.  In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).  This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result.","2574":"I like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0018CEABE\">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 5 Pound Bag<\/a> more than this flavor, and I suspect my pooch does too. We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank.","2575":"The ingredients are just great that's why I ordered it but when I opened the pouch and tasted... I know it's very healthy but this meal is not eatable.  I have ended up adding few spoons to meals I cook or just other baby food but this is it.","2576":"We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.","2577":"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors.","2578":"I really like the Happy Baby \"Chick Chick\" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different - much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood! It reminds me much too much of cat food.  All is not lost - our little guy would eat it, provided I dunked each bite in some pureed sweet potato or squash first. But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again.","2579":"we tried some other organic baby foods lately and she loved them but unfortunately she hates HATES HATES this food.  She's never had such a reaction to any food before but actually cried and screamed at the first taste of this.  I guess it's just not for her.  We've given her other foods from happy baby and she's loved them but this one she will not eat.  Too bad I bought a huge package!","2580":"My baby loves Happy Baby's Chick Chick meal, so we tried the salmon. It is the first food that my 11 month old has ever spit back at me. I tried to feed him this four different days to see if he would get used to it, or change his mind. No luck. It's too bad that you can only purchase them in lots of 16.... lots of leftover salmon here.","2581":"It smells delicious but unfortunately my 11 month old was having problems with the Amaranth.  He does eat some finger foods - mango, peaches, carrots, etc... but for some reason he was having problems with the Amaranth - maybe it was too grainy for him.  Will try it down the road again.","2582":"coffee maker is okay, but does not make a full cup of coffee, even when you select the larger cup. Kind of dissapointing.","2583":"New purchase!  Works fine but you get only little more than a half cup of coffee!! Had a Senseo that gave a full cup of coffee and tasted better! Would return item to Amazon but they won't accept returns on this item for any reason! I'll give this item to a family member who doesn't mind half cups of coffee!!","2584":"I visited my daughter in NC and she had the Keurig coffeemaker and I just loved it.  I ordered the Keurig K-Cup Home Brewer and I received it.  I just do not understand the 6 oz and 8 oz cups because the coffee does not come out to the full amount.  This is a problem and I do not understand why this is happening?  If I put it on the 8 oz it comes to a half a cup not the full size.","2585":"We bought the one cup thinking it was the perfect thing to brew coffee for my in-laws and herbal tea and apple cider for the rest of us.  But after brewing a few cups of coffee, it makes everything taste like coffee.  Mechanically it is working fine after two months.","2586":"I got these from the store the other day and the taste is nasty. They are good for sore throats though.","2587":"The product is good, the meat and cheese were as good I remember for pass years.  Unfortunately I found the amount of product very small.  There was more packaging then product.  What I mean is that the packaging made it look like you were getting more them there actually was.  I remember is years past you were able to get more for the money and in this case I felt is was a lot less even in today's economy.","2588":"Couldn't find in the description where this was pate.  My cat generally will not eat pate but one can down so we will see.  It would be nice if this was included in the description. - 1\/24\/2012","2589":"I was expecting some \"serious flavor\" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.","2590":"Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.  The product has more sunflower, corn and canola oils than it does olive oil!! The ingredients are NOT listed in the description.  I should have known better. There are other, much better \"Olive Oil\" potato chips on the market that use ONLY olive oil. I was quite disappointed in this brand.","2591":"I ordered these because I had purchased a bag of Sweet maui Onion chips from the supermarket. They were so good that I had to get another.  The order came and I popped open a bag. They are very crunchy, so if you're into that, these are the chips for you. However, they do tend to get really salty. I found myself having quite a few sips of beer when eating these","2592":"I bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients... but also specifically because they are gluten free.  I have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten... or Milk.  I was so upset when I received these to find out that they contain Milk!  I do not see this information anywhere on the product page.","2593":"If you're making Liege Waffles then you're in the right place. They're exactly what you need to get that caramelized exterior but still have a few crunchy bits in the waffle. I have to give it 3-stars through because this stuff is WAY too expensive. Amazon is the only place I can find this stuff, and I even live in the Dallas metro area.","2594":"I bought this for my girlfriend. I have one and she loves to make fun of me for it, so I thought I would get her one.  I ordered this from a different seller than I bought mine from, and though the tree is nice, it isn't as artfully \"crafted\" as mine was.  It was just looked like a small bush in a pot, unlike the one in the picture. I got mine from  tabletop-bonsai and it closely resembled the picture.","2595":"The product that I received is not the product pictured. The product that I received is the cascading variety of juniper bonsai, not the upright style that I thought I was going to receive.","2596":"I thought the tree would have been a little bigger. It's about the size of a small tea kettle. The pot in the picture is not the one it comes in. The tree could have been packaged better. It came in a regular usps box with regular packing foam balls.","2597":"My tree came in a very small size, I dont think it is 4 years old. It has only one branch.Mine doesnt look like on the picture.","2598":"The plant I received was nothing like the photo.  There is only one limb instead of the 3-4 shown. Thus it is not worth as much as the one in the photo.  Not such a good buy.  It WAS in good shape and seems to like my home.  Will see if it lasts long enough to grow the missing branches.","2599":"This tea is definitely worth trying as you may find that it's your favorite.  I've tried Irish Breakfast from most online Tea Shops to try to find one that is superior.  Taylor's has some fine teas, but I didn't find this variety superior enough to keep buying it.  I do buy their Yorkshire Gold, which is much stronger and great for when I need that.  I found that I enjoy Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast Tea just as much or more than this brand at around half the price or a little less.","2600":"Idea is clever;  buds look attractive in glass - but - they don't always open and some just \"lie there\"...  for the price, I'd expect more.","2601":"The caramels arrived quickly but were not soft when unwrapped.  It seems like they were not fresh.  I was disappointed and would not have bought them if I had known they would not be fresh.","2602":"These weren't as sour as we were expecting...especially when the name cry baby is attached to them. If you want a sour explosion, look elsewhere. The gum is good though, just not real sour.","2603":"I tried these tea bags at work and they were awesome.  So I looked for them and ordered.  While the flavor was great, the amount of tea in each bag is so little, it takes awhile to seap.  I like mine strong so I need to wait awhile or use two.","2604":"My cats ate it but they didn't seem to like it to well.Wouldn't buy it again.","2605":"It looks and smells really good. It has no harmful additives. It is in a cute package. It has names of food that I like. If only my cats could appreciate all of the above qualities! I wonder if other people's cats do. I couldn't find any fault with the food, but then again, I'm human. I'd say it probably depends very much on what your cat's taste is. If your cat enjoys fresh organic food... then buy this. If they like Fancy Feast - don't!!","2606":"My cats all eat this, but I find it messy to serve, especially the chicken pot pie cans which seem to be 50 percent liquid. When you pull off the pop top, you can't help but get splashed by it. And it seems like you're not getting that much food for your money since it's so much liquid. The Chinese chicken is not as liquidy.  I have no idea how to compare this to other brands price-wise because it is not sold in my state. I've never seen it in stores.","2607":"Pretty good by the cat's standards, about 50% of them like it and 50% don't (we have rescue foster cats that come and go).","2608":"Our four cats liked the Petite Cuisine for a couple of short weeks, but now none of them are interested in eating it (including one voracious eater who eats most anything and is the first at the bowl and the last to leave).","2609":"These catfoods come in smaller cans, which is great for one serving. Upon opening, they look delicious. However, not all cats like it. I tried one of each with my two, who love fish and seafood, and they sniffed and walked away. A neighbor's cat and two friend's cats loved it. So, as we all know with cats... they can be finicky! I would have to say give it a try and see if yours like it. They really look great, smaller cans store easily also.","2610":"I know, I should have read the whole description before ordering these, but I thought they were the \"bite size\" cookies, and instead they are VERY MINI cookies, like smaller than MnM's.  It makes them a little hard to eat, and they are a huge mess for kids, but they taste good!","2611":"The Torani chocolate & raspberry sugar-free syrups were to die for!  :)  The caramel was pretty bad, I thought.  The others were good but I wouldn't order them again.  I think this is personal preference stuff.","2612":"The vanilla, chocolate and irish cream are yummy. The others . . . not so much. But it does make a nice addition to my ever-growing wet bar. they are sweet, so go easy with them.  I find all it takes is about 1-1.5 cap fulls to flavor the drink. anything more than that and you get that artificial sweetener taste.  Also, for those that care, the irish cream, chocolate, hazelnut and raspberry are gluten free.","2613":"Bought to supplement taste on food plan but selection was not disclosed and took a gamble.  Good selection for coffee, not for my uses.  Product is great.","2614":"This is a great amount for the money.  I didn't like the taste of sugar free though.  I'll be ordering the regular kind.","2615":"Love the six-pack .... but not all the flavors. Would love to be able to pick the ones I wanted. Why not give us a choice of all the available flavors? My favorites are the caramel, hazelnut, and vanilla. I wouldn't mind getting two of each of those on the next order. Is this possible?","2616":"Squash is one food that my son always tolerated and the Gerber squash was always a hit. The only problem I had with this \"stage 3\" version was that it didn't seem thick enough to be a stage 3 food. I wish that it wasn't quite so runny.","2617":"They are very good but you can get those for about 9 bucks at your local warehouse store.","2618":"Pine nuts are expensive and I did appreciate the price for 2 lbs. of them.  Unfortunately, they are not as tasty as I have had so I rate them at B or B+ compared to what I have had in the past.","2619":"For some reason, the instructions say to only cook this in the microwave.  I don't know why since it's not quick oats, but more like the old fashioned oatmeal that you have to cook on the stove.  It takes about 5 minutes to cook in the microwave and you have to make sure to use a good size bowl or it will boil over and make a huge mess.  As for the taste, only one of my kids likes it.  For the rest of us, it's just a very strange flavor for oatmeal.","2620":"Good product, but more of a treat for my dogs.  It took them just a matter of minutes to have the SmartBone gone.  Maybe good for dogs that are not big chewers.  I was hoping for something more digestible but as sturdy as rawhides","2621":"Great product but made in China. Once I realized this after purchase, I got a little worried. Kind of over priced in the regular retail market. My dogs like it & have been ok but I wish I knew ahead of time where it was made.","2622":"I was definitely expecting something fabulous by the way Oprah and her guests spoke about this product.  It was tasty, but by no means the dessert to end all desserts.  My husband, who is the real chocolate lover in our family, just shrugged and said it was okay.  Oh well, it was worth a try.  I'm just glad I didn't buy a 5-pack of the product.","2623":"Despite this being 100% Arabica it had a sharpness to the flavor that I'm more used to finding in blends including Robusta. There's nothing wrong with the quality, and I applaud Lavazza for introducing a Fair Trade coffee, but it just wasn't to my taste I'm afraid.","2624":"I have bought this 2 other times and really enjoyed it... so much so I subscribed.  However, this time I don't think the bag they sent was a recent roast because it was very flat and the crema was poor compared to the previous batches.  I will buy it one more time and if it is like this one, I will not be buying it again.  They are definitely having issues with quality control if batches can taste so differently from each other.","2625":"Lavazza is definitely a great value.  Superior quality and taste for the price.  Illy rules but you pay for it.  This one has a bit of sourness compared to the others but I don't mind much.","2626":"Good coffee but a medium roast. If you dwell in the Northwest US, or prefer dark roast ala Starbucks,this is not likely going to satisfy you.","2627":"Lavazza is a top name in coffee but I found this to be nothing special and not creating a large amount of crema when brewed in an esspresso machine","2628":"These are a tad sweet for my taste, and also a bit too squishy. I like that they are organic, but wish they were more tart and a bit drier.","2629":"This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well.","2630":"I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.","2631":"McVities digestive biscuits are great - not nearly as sweet as competitors. Biggest problem is how many are broken by the time they get to you. The Amazon packaging job does not hold up in shipping. This is true for all types of digestives I have received over the last couple of years from Amazon. Unfortunately they are the best source in the US. I wish they could think up a better packaging scenario for fragile items like this.","2632":"The biscuit is reasonably good, better than most made in US biscuits. However, Amazon's packaging is horrendous. Most of the biscuit came crushed in their individual packs.","2633":"This product needs to have better packaging.  Many of the biscuits arrived broken and crumbly which detracts from any prospect of reordering.","2634":"These cookies are very tasty. Mildly sweet & satisfying. However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges. These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles. We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes, but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.","2635":"I must be one of the unlucky ones: mine arrived pulverized!  Bubble wrap on the top only, with no second, outer box.","2636":"As usual the biscuits is very good. Normally we get couple of biscuits that are totally crumble once we get it. This time a whole packet (out of 7) is totally worthless. Expect not to get similar again.","2637":"These cookies are very tasty.  Mildly sweet & satisfying.  However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges.  These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles.  We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes, but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.","2638":"The product has withstood the ravages of time and is a Brit favorite. The product packing was good but the box the seven packs came in was very poorly packed resulting in a 20% breakage","2639":"I recieved the Mcvities biscuts in the mail and was surprised to see the ingredients werent written in english and there was an Arab due by date. This is a product supposedly made in Britain. Im uncomfortable to say the least about this. SO its nly getting 3 stars from me.","2640":"You can get the same Tea at most of the Asian Groceries at around 7 dollars. The tea is good, but at $18, its a rip off.","2641":"These are a little bland, but not bad. They taste more like rice cakes than popcorn, though","2642":"Bought the Jumbo Greenies for my Black Lab. He loved them, but at $2.66 each they are way too expensive for regular use.  Didn't notice any difference in breath which was the primary reason for buying.","2643":"These bones are great for a dog's breath. However, I was looking for something that would take him more than a minute to chew. Still a good treat for doggy breath.","2644":"I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning.","2645":"I have used these little treats for our 2 dogs for a while and never had a problem.  This time the container arrived a little dented and when I opened it, discovered that the inside pouch had been damaged and the greenies are stuck together.  Disappointing.","2646":"I read the reviews and decided to purchase Greenies for my two dogs.  Unfortunately, neither one will eat them.  I gave one box to my son and one to my daughter and thier dogs love them.  Go figure.","2647":"Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w\/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!","2648":"When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot.","2649":"I thought the greenies were the petite size for small dogs instead they were much larger. I'm having to cut them in half for my 6# Yorkie.","2650":"Dogs love them, this box was economical as compared to vet prices, BUT they by no means help my dog's bad breath.  I get stared down every night at \"TREAT TIME\" by my golden retrieve and sheltie, until I am forced to get out of my comfy chair and give them their EXPECTED DESSERT every single night.  As always, my dogs walk all over me! lol","2651":"My  dogs love them.. They are pricey for a treat tho! I did not notice any change on their teeth -plaque stayed the same.. even tho I gave it to my  dog 2 times a day for few months. Still needed to go to the vet for  deep teeth cleaning.","2652":"I'm not sure how much I like this product because I'm always a little concerned our puppies might choke on the Greenies which tend to be a bit small.  When it comes to oral hygiene, I actually prefer the CET chews:  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001P3PR54\">C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Petite Dogs, 30 Chews<\/a>.  Having said that, if you already know you like Greenies, this seems to be the best price anywhere...","2653":"I bought two of these at a pet store. One for 100lb plus dogs. My lab is 45 lbs. She consumed it in minutes. I also got a small one for my older chihuahua mix, she consumed it within minutes. Long lasting they are not !  Bull sticks are the only item I have found that last a while. However they smell bad. Even the so called orderless ones.","2654":"I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.  They were too big for my cat.","2655":"hello,  i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size \"petite\". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no \"e\" at the end?!  thanks","2656":"While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size) My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price. I'll be trying other brands.","2657":"These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry.","2658":"My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean. she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two.","2659":"While most liquid is packaged by volume this is packaged by weight.  I was able to resolve my complaint with Amazon but I want other shoppers to be aware that his is smaller than you might expect. I estimate that each bottle is 24oz by volume.  Still a pretty good deal but not the steal I was hoping for!","2660":"I love agave nector. It tastes just as good as sugar but so much better for you! The only issue I have is that it's not as big as you would imagine. It was actually cheaper for me to buy 2, 2 packs of agave at costco and I got more for my money.","2661":"The price on this product was quite good.  I was aware before I bought it that it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, which I avoid like the plague because it increases one's triglycerides.  But then so does honey.  Agave nectar doesn't solidify as honey does, so it is more convenient to store and use up slowly in applications where a liquid sweetener is desirable.  I use it sparingly.","2662":"We received the product in a timely manner after placing the order but it was expired when it arrived based on the date stamped on the neck of the bottles.","2663":"I have been using the agave for years and i must report that it hav changed> it is much thinner and not as sweet so you must use more.","2664":"Had previously used Lavender oil by NOW.  Sorry I bought this brand, won't do it again. It's much thinner than anything else I've used.","2665":"My Basenji & Australian Shepherd find these cookies boring, but they're half the price of the other treats I normally buy, & are corn & wheat free.  The solution: an economy size jar of peanut butter.  Suddenly these cookies work.  They also look funny while eating it.","2666":"It is hard to write a review for an item sent as a gift to someone else.  It seems that when you order this you may receive the Chocolate, but you may instead receive the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B005EF0I0I\">Coffee Sampler Gift Basket by ig4U<\/a>, as my gift recipient did.  Thankfully she loves coffee, so it was not a total bomb, but her packing list DID say Chocolate AND I wanted to send Chocolate.","2667":"This garlic-flavored oil is nice, but does not have the strength of garlic I had hoped for. As a bread-dipping oil, it just does not produce that tang of garlic I prefer. If you like only the merest hint of garlic, this may be for you.","2668":"At first this was a great toy, lasted forever.  but then the smart husky figured out how to unscrew the cap, it was all over then.","2669":"I have counted, and (no joke), have, over the past 4 years, purchased 18 of these Busy Buddy Toys.  This is good (because obviously we love them), but, find that, after about a month, we need to order a new one, because my dogs jaws are so strong that, he breaks the toy.  We eventually needed to stop buying the toy :(","2670":"This product is good in theory, however just couldnt get our dog to pay attention to it after training him that food comes out when you tug. He still just tried to lick in the open hole....he is too used to his Kong. But it is really put together well. I like it, but unfortunatley my dog does not,therefore I had to put it at 3 stars.","2671":"I liked this toy when I first got it and it kept my 1 1\/2 year old corgi busy for a while. I put his food in it and a few other \"interactive toys\" to keep him busy, this toy is actually too easy for him and lately  he will only get about half the kibble out and then loose interest. The other thing I don't like is that I can't wash it without getting the rope all wet. It would be better if you could twist off the rope portion and throw it in the dishwasher.","2672":"My 10-month pitbull loves this, but she chewed through the rope on this toy within her third day of having it.  That's a pretty short life for $14 so for those of you who have had the same thing happened here's what I did: forget the rope and put a tennis ball or two inside with kibble.  It's not exactly a tug jug anymore, but it does take a little work to get the food out.","2673":"<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:01 Mins  <\/span>Tucker was nervous about this toy at first (as you'll see in the video) but really warmed up to it quickly and has enjoyed gnawing on it.  However, this has not worked very well for us as a treat dispenser.  I consider Tucker to be quite a clever puppy, but after fiddling with the tug-a-jug for a couple days, he just began bringing the thing to me and dropping it at my feet for me to dispense the treats for him.  (I suppose that may be evidence of just how clever he is!)","2674":"My corgi's are food obsessed and love their Kongs.  I was hoping that this toy would keep them occupied.  But, even though I put some high value treats in it, my dogs had no interest.  From my corgis' POV, this is a * item, but I gave it *** because it seems well made.","2675":"The product itself is good I suppose.  Maybe it's just my dog.  I have a 7 month old lab, and he can't figure out how to get the food out very well.  It's kinda hard for me too--I have to hold the rope part with one hand and shake the bottle with the other hand.  So I can see why it's hard for dogs.  But anyway--the product is very durable, and maybe Samson will learn the trick one day.","2676":"i bought this thinking that it was a really good idea to keep the pup busy, but upon introducing it to my boston terrier, he was a bit hesitant about approaching the toy.  i think it's the spikey round opening of the container.  plus, he's not a \"puller\" so he hasn't quite figured out how to get the treats out.  it's been more frustrating than fun for him thus far.  all in all, a nice idea but not an intuitive toy for dogs.","2677":"I at 1st thought I ordered the wrong size but I guess the small size is pretty big. My dog Dingo, who is from a rescue in Taiwan, took to this pretty well. He really doesn't know what toys are but knows how to get food out. This toy is a bit trickier then the others but I heard (won't let me watch) him playing with this and I believe he has been able to get a few kibble bits out.  I will update once I'm actually able to watch him. Until then I give this 3 stars.","2678":"This  is  too big  for dogs  under  15 pounds and  has  not  proven effective for us","2679":"This bottle is big!  You can put lots of food in here which comes out a little too easy.  When I put treats in it's very difficult to get out and my husband thinks that's mean.  The dogs only like this toy when there are treats inside.  Otherwise I think they don't get the rope and the bottle is big and akward.","2680":"it took our dog about a week to figure this out. once she got it, she loved it and it kept her busy for a long time. the only problem is that it got moldy and when i tried to clean it, the rope never dried and the mold got worse. had to throw it out.","2681":"Lab enjoys the toy--now. When the rope was attached to it, he couldn't get the treats out at all and we were using TINY treats. He destroyed the rope in a few minutes and now the treats fall out.","2682":"Try putting a tennis ball inside the bottle. My Border collie chewed the rope out too- to make it more challenging then just knocking it over and treats spilling out really easy, I put a smaller sized tennis ball inside so she still has to work the bottle back and forth in order to get the treats to go from the back of the bottle to the neck. Hope this helps! -Ali & *Kylie *the border collie\/flat coat retriever mix","2683":"I thought the large would be too big for my Corgi's, but they seem to manage with it just fine. I did not notice that it comes in different sizes. My dog figured out how to get the treats out pretty quickly though. I also have the StarMark bob-a-lot and that seems to take them a little longer to get at the treats. You can adjust the hole sizes on the bob-a-lot.","2684":"It's kind of noisy so my dog doesn't love it. It's kind of an awkward design. There are better treat toys out there - my dog loves the disc shaped one.","2685":"I have a one year old lab mix that we adopted from a shelter. Got him as a puppy. I got this toy because I work out of the house, and he is constantly wanting me to play with him. Thought this would be ideal. Have no idea whether this is a good toy or not because my dog is afraid of it. He does not like anything that makes noise!! So, in theory it is a great toy, in practice, in my house, it's a bust!","2686":"I Initially liked it but when left alone with my dog, her chewed thru the rope and plunger rendereing it useless. Lasted less then a week with my destroyer of a dog.","2687":"This toy is great for keeping a dog entertained, but not very sturdy. Granted I have 2 huskies who can destroy anything anyways, but...I have tried the KONG brand and never had a problem. Other toys as well. This one didn't last 30 minutes in their presence though.  It is a good idea for smaller dogs.","2688":"I was quit suprised how big this tug-a-war toy was when I opened it.  My two pit bulls love it.  Unfortunetly, I read the precautions that stated not good if dogs shake and throw it around, after already purchasing it.  That's what one of my dog loves to do...so I try to give it to her while in her dog crate.","2689":"Dog enjoyed playing with toy but the plastic bottle broke fairly quickly from being smacked around. Engaging but not durable.","2690":"I got this toy for my Border Collies and they had one really good play session with it before they tore it up.  The bottle itself survived, but the rest of it was ruined, so you couldn't use it as a treat dispenser which was the point.  I was hoping it would keep them busy\/entertained. I think it would be okay for dogs that aren't as aggressive though.  My dogs can tear up pretty much anything though! lol","2691":"This is a great toy that my dog loved, but it didn't last very long. She likes to whip her toys around, and knocked this on something, and the container cracked. Also, the new style of toy has a nylon \"flossy\" style rope that is difficult to clean--man, that thing got smelly fast from kibble & doggy drool!  Overall, great concept, but I wouldn't recommend if your dog is rough with their toys...","2692":"The shipping was very fast. The product is super durable. It did not hold my dogs interest for to long. I am going to try a better treat and see if that works a little better. I say give it a try as long as its on sale.","2693":"My parents have a Carolina Dog who is not a big chewer. She loves this toy, and it keeps her occupied for a while. Seeing how much she loved it, I decided to get one for my 1 year old beagle. Within an hour or so, he had the rope completely chewed up which takes away the real intention of the toy. He still plays with the bottle itself, but there's no point in putting treats in it because they just fall out. This toy is not for hardcore chewers.","2694":"My dog will tug at the rope and push the bottle around until every last bit of kibble is out of there, but she doesn't like playing with it nearly as much as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001F0RRUA\">Premier Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Dog Toy<\/a>. Both of my dogs will play with that ball (and chew on it) for hours. Keeps them both busy and away from my shoes!","2695":"It seems like a nice durable toy but my dog could care less.  A few sniffs, nose up, and that was that.  Doesn't matter what treats are in it or even if we dispense them.  I thought it would be nice for a bored dog, but this is a dog that, apparently, prefers boredom to gastric pleasure.  I gave it 3 stars because it does seem to be well constructed, but not five stars since it was utterly pointless purchase, at least for me.","2696":"Have a border collie that I was hoping would love this toy.  It is sturdy enough and well made but I can't find any kibble that fits.  Anything I have put in the jar is too large for the dog to successfully get out.  Right now she just walks around with the rope in her mouth and the jar dangling.  Just be aware that it takes a very small treat to go in the jar.","2697":"My dog just got mad they couldn't get the treats out and ripped the rope right out. He's a pretty strong chewer but not extraordinary. He's only a 70 lb coonhound. Just an FYI to ya'll. I thought it was a little difficult for them to get treats but maybe my dogs aren't the smartest. Anyway, the search continues for the perfect dog toy.","2698":"within five minutes my 11 month old 60 lb collie\/saint Bernard mix had chewed the rope in half.  I used suggestion given by another reviewer and put a racket ball in the bottle.","2699":"Great Idea! Great toy to keep dog occupied. BUT....  HOWEVER, in serious need of design improvement. I went through 2 toys and had same problem with both. Lid cracked where lid joins jug, making toy worthless. Needs rubberized bottom or screw at the top of jug.","2700":"This is a great toy, but the bottle is just too big for a small dog.  The only way to get the treats out is to turn the bottle upside down and my dog's mouth is too small to grab the base of the bottle and he weighs 20 lbs.  He can demolish a bully stick in less than five minutes, but cannot grab the base of this bottle to stand it on it's top.  It's a clever toy for a medium to large dog!","2701":"My golden just picks up the bottle and dumps everything out.  Larger dogs should use to big one that they can't get their mouth around.","2702":"I gave this item a three because it only lasted a couple of hours before my 2 year old Wheaten Terrier chewed the rubber cord apart. It's a good thing I was watching hime or he would have swallowed it. That being said my girlfriends 3 year old 90 pound chow mix loves it. He chews on other things but loves this toy!","2703":"My dog just isn't a \"tugger\" by nature. She doesn't get this toy, and the same hard plastic that makes it super durable also makes it super LOUD when it hits the hardwood floor. Noise=scary. My dog developed a phobia of this toy long before she ever figured out how to get the food out of it. I had to pass it along to someone else. Hopefully it will find a home with a dog who really loves it.","2704":"The toy got a lot of interest, but I eventually had to take it away because of the way my dogs chose to play with it. They would grab it by the rope and shake their heads to release this treats, subsequently beating walls (or worse, human legs) that were near them. It appeared to be sturdy, and probably would have been a good toy otherwise.","2705":"I followed all the instructions and great guidance from this site, but my dog - a rescue dog, formerly an outside dog and not used to 'toys' didn't figure this out. Perhaps if another dog showed him the way, he'd get it. The product otherwise was well-made and a creative idea!","2706":"While the concept is great - my dog LOVES empty pop bottles - he doesn't have any interest in this particular toy. I think it is pretty sturdy, though I may not be the best judge as he hasn't really played hard with it. He has a ton of toys and this is his least favorite. It really is a good idea though and I do like how well it was made.","2707":"My beagle really enjoyed working to get his treats out of this ball for the first couple days then he chewed through the rubber piece for tugging so now if we put treats in they just fall out.","2708":"We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber \"rope.\"  My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred.  This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up.  She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug.  So I am disappointed they changed it.","2709":"My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest.  Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full.  He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around.  I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy.","2710":"I have a 45lb lab mix that loves his busy buddy, but that cheap rubber rope lasted all of 20 min with him. He chewed it down to a nub. A thicker rope or actual rope might be a better choice. Or maybe Kong like rubber!  That said, he goes bonkers for this and clangs it noisily all around on the hardwood floors. It gets to be a bit much. But he sure has fun!","2711":"It's a good concept, but the rope part of the tug a jug is not as durable as I thought.  My Corgi\/Australian Shepherd puppy cleanly separated the rope into 2 pieces so now it's just a jug.","2712":"Our pit mix loves to chew especially when bored.  We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy.","2713":"I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one.","2714":"Works great for my GSD with one exception. I had to remove the rubber rope from the bottle. Otherwise it would be impossible to get the food out!! Maybe this is because his food is larger I really dont know however, with the rope gone he stays active until all the food is out. Good buy since I purchased it from target at the clearanced price of 3 dollars!","2715":"The Tug-A-Jug is a cleverly designed toy that does a good job of entertaining\/occupying a dog, but my 85 pound Weimaraner destroyed the largest model inside of a few hours. It's also noisy for indoor use.","2716":"Our dog does enjoy this toy, but the constant slamming on our wood floors is annoying. The rubber part actually lasted a month, which is a record for our chewer.","2717":"Well, this was purchased to keep our two canine \"monkeys\" busy while we're out. Even after filling the toy with the YUMMIEST treats (dried chicken jerky) and showing both dogs what to do they gave up after only a few minutes... no go","2718":"My 70lbs. lab\/hound mix likes this toy OK. He hasn't figured out how it works to get the food out but he does like to carry it around in his mouth by the rope. Not as entertaining for him as I hoped but we're still giving him time to figure it out. We've tried to show him but he's never gotten the food out on his own and he's a pretty smart dog. -B","2719":"We just bought this toy, and it is definetly something our dog loves and is interested in for a good period of time. It took her less than 20 minutes to figure out she just had to chew through the rope. If they could do a second version with a rope made of Kevlar or a metal chain with knots -that would be much better!","2720":"I think the problem with this toy is that the rope fills up too much of the bottle neck which makes getting a treat out of the container nearly impossible.  It is certainly a sturdy product though, but having Boxers I can just imagine one of them grabbing it by the rope and swinging it around, and breaking something in my house.","2721":"Very duriable item.  85-lb dog hasn't destroyed it yet.  It drops food rather fast though.  If you want more regular food coming out, get this toy.","2722":"I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to break by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one.  Another new toy, doomed to failure.  &lt;sigh>  oh well, at least I tried.","2723":"I didn't realize this was so big until I got it.  I ended giving it to my Fiance's mom for her GSD.","2724":"I have a 5 month old Australian shepherd and she could not get the treats out--we couldn't either. What we finally ended up doing was boring a hole at the bottom; luckily my husband had the tools to make a smooth hole big enough for her kibbles. It now works very well as a treat dispenser, but my dog doesn't really play with it like a toy.","2725":"My 14 month old Border Collie wanted nothing to do with this toy... so I gave it to my freinds 12 month old Lab ...and he also ignored it.. so now it just sits there... I cant even give it away :0(","2726":"Pretty cool idea.  Lab loved it for a while...then it broke when it got tossed onto the driveway - bye, bye, toy!","2727":"My dog managed to chew threw the rubber tug in less than 30 seconds.  That being said, I can't say that the toy is a total loss.  I turned the leftover part upside down in the jug and it is fairly effective at slowing down the dispensation of the food treats that are inside.  Keeps mine amused for as long as the food is in there","2728":"My dog really enjoyed this. she spent hours trying to get the treats out. but in the first 10 minutes she chewed the plastic 'rope' in half out of frustration. So now the toy doesn't work as intended, but still i put her dog food in there since i know she'll be able to get it out pretty easily, it will just take more work than the bowl. This is a really great toy, just wish the rope would have lasted a day. so be sure to supervise play before you leave your dog with this one.","2729":"I bought this cake because I miss the seven layer cakes that are available in New York (where I grew up).  There was not enough cake.  And, the filling was not the light colored chocolate buttercream as shown in the picture. It was more chocolate frosting.","2730":"My dog loves Stella and Chewy's, especially the carnivore kisses (dog crack), so I thought I'd try these.  My dog refuses to eat these.  She won't even bury them for future use.  She just gives me a look and spits them out.  I tried giving them to my mom's dog since mine won't eat them, but her dog doesn't want anything to do with them either.  I don't know why they don't like them.","2731":"I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She loved the box and the candy was tasty but if you look at the picture in their advertisement it must be a close up because what I saw come out of the box looked like about half of what they show.  Truthfully, unless you're into home made candy, save your money and buy some English Toffee at Walmart.  It's probably just about as good and a lot less expensive.","2732":"I found that about a month before the expiration date these tasted stale to me.  So have several bags left from the case I bought that are not that good anymore.  I bought the sniders organic pretzels and those held up better.","2733":"We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'","2734":"I ordered a case of these pretzels to give away as snacks--I ordered it on Dec 17 and when it came, it had the \"Use By Dec 27, 2011\" date stamped on each bag. I'm not happy that they sent me \"old\" product that is nearing the end of its shelf life.","2735":"Purchased these on sale around superbowl time when we go through lots of dips.  Normally buy locally, but the town was sold out and we try to be as organic as possible.  Family has mixed reviews about taste & texture.","2736":"I'll begin by saying I wish the description stated clearly that these clams come from China.  Secondly, every can in the pack of three has dents in it.  Since when is it acceptable to sell dented canned goods?  There was not a scratch on the outer box, so I know that those dented cans were intentionally boxed and shipped.  I'm going to cancel my subscribe-and-save for this product.","2737":"They didnt made proper package. No bubble plastic to cover them, so some of the cans  were hitted damaged. please improve packaging.","2738":"This is the first Stevia I ever bought.  I liked it when I got it...until I tasted other brands.  It's OKAY.  But I prefer the stuff in the packets (dry.)  I especially LOVE the crystals that are made out of a stevia\/cane sugar mix--and they're only 5 calories per packet and I only put one packet in my coffee....I guess I need to find that product and review it-ha!  But this is definitely worth a try.  It's cheap and lasts a LONG time.  I think it tastes much better in tea, than coffee though.","2739":"Had an acidic taste to me. It did ok at flavoring things, but I didn't think it was sweet enough. I wouldn't buy again.","2740":"The toffee taste is very good.  It's buttery and rich, like English Toffee.  But, the stevia is very bitter.  I don't understand why the sweetener is so bitter.  I will stick with my Xylitol and know that I am helping my oral health with it's use.","2741":"I love it, but, then, I use it in Pero, a coffee substitute which I fear not all would enjoy","2742":"Of course its easy enough to ignore the plethora of research saying this stuff is beyond bad for your liver but what really takes the cake is the fact that many people [not including myself] think it tastes downright awful. Me and my friends drank this tea and while the first one or two cups were tasty, I found one of my friends complaining of how disgusting it was while the other one threw up several times. While my experience was marginally good, I can't say i would endorse this product.","2743":"This price is a little high.  You can generally buy it in a grocery store for around $1.25 a bottle.  For some reason the seller claims they don't like the flavor.  It tastes like ORange Hi-C which I think is good.  Kind of like less sugary Kool Aid.  I love the taste.  Plus, there are 2.5 servings in  each bottle - so each bottle is 125 calories.  The product is good.  I think Revive flavor is the best.","2744":"I never use the whole sauce packet, there's some fish sauce in it that just overwhelms the whole bowl with a salty taste I don't like. If I use 1\/2 or less of the sauce packet it doesn't overwhelm the dehydrated veggies, and is ok - not my favorite though.","2745":"I wanted to like the Whole Wheat Shells & Cheddar.  I really did.  But the sauce really is quite watery and bland, even with adding the optional butter\/margarine.  Alone, cooked per instructions, my kids wouldn't eat this.  I certainly couldn't feed it to kid guests used to traditional mac-n-cheese.  But I discovered that if I mixed in some leftover spaghetti sauce it becomes quite tasty.  I use a jarred sauce added to browned ground beef.  Now that makes a very hearty and tasty meal.","2746":"I'm a big fan of Annie's Shells and White Cheddar (the purple box), so I figured I'd try this to see if it was as good. It's ok, but the whole grain pasta is very whole-grainy. It doesn't quite cook the same, the texture difference is very noticeable and the sauce doesn't seem to blend with it as well.","2747":"I would recommend trying Rishi's matcha super green tea (sencha and matcha blend) over this one.  That tea is very similar but the grassy taste is balanced a bit better.","2748":"the package states that the product is match tea yet it is NOT matcha tea.  It is a loose tea leaf blend.  The tea itself is quite tasty but it was not what i was looking for.....","2749":"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again.","2750":"The pieces of grits are much larger than average sized grits, but the flavor is better, as these are true yellow corn grits, and not bleached out hominy grits. I have since trying this brand purchased some regular sized non-bleached organic yellow corn grits and like them much better. Also, this brand is quite expensive, even considering that you get the reuseable baggy, when compared to the price of the finer ground organic grits I purchased elsewhere, which only cost $1.79\/lb. as opposed to the price of these grits and getting less than a pound.","2751":"I have purchased these chunks from Amazon for several years since most local groceries no longer carry the chunks.  I've been happy with the price and service but I noticed they have halved the size of the case and it is nearly the price of a case of 12 a year ago.  I'm not blaming Amazon for the change--I'm blaming the company for poor customer service.  What used to cost around $28 is now over $40.  Shame on you Baker's!","2752":"I'm always looking for new flavors for my cooking. Supposedly, sumac gives a lemon flavor. I tried using it in rice and with fish, but I can't tell that it's even there. I'm not even sure if it is supposed to be cooked. Maybe it should be just sprinkled on after cooking. I've used it in tandem with preserved lemons, but I think it was the lemons that gave the dish such a strong lemon flavor.","2753":"Here are the ingredients: All Natural Almondmilk (Filtered Water, Almonds), All Natural Evaporate Cane Juice, Calcium Carbonate, Sea Salt, Locust Bean Gum, Sunflower Lecithin, Gellan Gum, d-alpha-Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Zinc Gluconate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Riboflavin (B2), Vitamin B12, Vitamin D2.  Locust Bean Gum, Sunflower Lecithin, and Gellan Gum are thickeners.  There's also 50% of the RDA of Vitamin E and 45% of the RDA of Calcium in 1 cup.  It seems excessively supplemented.","2754":"The milk is \"creamy\" and tastes nice. No complaints on this front. However, WholeFoods sells organic almond milk for a lot less. This product is great to have in the pantry but I would not be buying frequently from Amazon.","2755":"I thought I was ordering unsweetened, since I typed \"Almond Milk Unsweetened\" in the search bar. This product came up as the #2 selection, and the price was good, so I bought it. After it arrived, I noticed that it had cane sugar in the ingredients. You would think with unsweetened in the search engine, Amazon would do a better sorting job than to have a sweetened version as the #2 choice. My fault for not looking more closely. Live and learn, the Amazon search engine isn't perfect. Since I cannot have sugar, I cannot rate the product.","2756":"After using Almond Powder in Europe, I decided to try my luck with it in the US and couldn't find it anywhere. Finally I bumped into this and decided to try my luck. Personally I thought it still too coarse to be called a \"powder\". But so far I still haven't found any other company that holds this product around here so if I am ever in need of Almond Powder again I'd probably go back to this company for more.","2757":"Good in a pinch but better to make your own.  Also, the can size is too small for most recipes.","2758":"I first purchased Paula Deens House seasoning at Big Lots and loved ,loved,loved this seasoning. When looked for more to purchas I looked everywhere and was thrilled to find the best price on Amazon. So I ordered 4 bottles. I couldn't be more disappointed to find the spices are not the same. The taste is not the same ....Why ??? If you make a produce that is good don't change it..","2759":"I was disappointed that the pancakes did not raise more. I followed the instructions exactly and the pancakes turned out very thin.  They did have a lot of blueberries and tasted good.","2760":"SMELL OF DRY GROUNDS: Very strange. Different than regular coffee. A little like sweet garbage. Made me worried that the coffee would be disgusting.  SIZE OF BAG: Enough for about 5 generous scoops.  TASTE OF BREWED COFFEE: Passable. Nothing great, but nothing bad. Had a slight wang and a little bit of an aftertaste like old or cheap coffee.  ACID: A 3-ounce bag wasn't enough to really determine if it was easier to digest than regular coffee. Neither of us drinking the coffee seemed to experience any acid reflex afterward. Still, not enough to truly tell.","2761":"I don't have any reason not to believe that this coffee is good for those reflux or acid sufferers. If you really have a serious problem and can't drink the stuff, try it. (I am a \"refluxer\", but not of the serious kind.) So, this coffee did not give me any heartburn or acid reflux. But in terms of quality (taste) it is no better nor worse than any Folgers or Taster's Choice. You should perhaps investigate whether the price justifies it.","2762":"I was concerned that the beneficial features of this particular brew were going to give it a distinctively different flavor. I was imagining something like a dark tea. This, however, was not the case. I found the flavor to be pleasant. Not as rich as the same flavor from other popular brands, but pleasant.  If I were a more serious sufferer of acid reflux, I certainly believe that the small sacrifice in flavor would be worth it. For me, personally, I will probably stick with my regulars.","2763":"While I'm a big coffee drinker, I'm no fan of Starbucks in-home brews. That being said, I work at a firm where they order Starbucks' French and Breakfast blends, but I order in my own instant NesCafe Clasico. I ordered Puroast's this time, but it tastes the same as the bitter ones, seems a bit acidic for being \"Low Acid,\" and leaves a bitter aftertaste.  I actually had to mix it in with some creamers (Coffeemate's French and regular). To me, it's as though I were drinking Starbucks' versions, so I see no difference.","2764":"I'm more of a tea drinker, but enjoy an occasional cuppa joe. But the acid never bothered me. I won't say I missed it here, but the flavor didn't wow me, and lactose, alcohol, and smoking all seem to give me the \"fiery urp,\" the acid in coffee not so much. It wasn't bad tasting, mind you, and if you love coffee but get heartburn from high acidity, it's probably worth a shot. Not my cup of tea though!","2765":"My husband suffers from heart burn and takes antacids daily, so I had him give Puroast a try. His thoughts are:  - the Puroast is tolerable if there is no other alternative, but it does not compare well in his mind to regular coffee. The taste was somewhat bitter  - given the price - almost $18 for 10 packs - it's almost better just not to drink coffee at all  - if you must absolutely have some sort of coffee and cannot at all have regular coffee, this might be an acceptable alternative.","2766":"....but on the plus side, no heartburn as I sometimes get when drinking coffee.  I made this 3 ounces (1 packet) to a full pot of water in my 12 cup drip coffeemaker, maybe that was the reason for the weakness. I was expecting it to be stronger since \"dark\" was in the flavor name. Nice aroma and no bitterness, but unless my heartburn issues get worse in the future, I will stick to my regular mocha\/espresso drinks and my CBTL machine.","2767":"I definitely noticed a difference in the way my stomach reacted to this coffee -- much less acid, fewer jitters. However, while the French Roast coffee tastes pretty good, there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste that is unpleasant. Overall, this is just OK.","2768":"I found it a bit flat, maybe because it lacked the aroma I associate with good coffee.  It tastes a bit muddy, but it did not seem acidic. It has a nice label! I have to say that I prefer Folger's.","2769":"If not for the low acid, I would never recommend this coffee. The taste was uneven and flat, not a French Roast by any stretch of the imagination.  I like my coffee strong and smooth, and I figured that low acid would be reflected in a smoother taste, but it was not. To be fair, I have not had a lot of low acid coffees for comparison.  I suppose that if acid is a real concern, someone could drink this. I don't take milk and sugar, so maybe the addition of those would disguise...er, improve the taste.","2770":"The taste is decent.  Not good, but not really horrible.  If it didn't kick off my reflux, I could live with it.  But, unfortunately, it does, so I can't, so the taste is irrelevant.  I appreciate them trying!  Maybe a dark french roast isn't the best flavor for a low-acid coffee drink though?  I'm rating this three stars because I think someone with less severe reflux might be okay with it.","2771":"I got a sample French Roast and it was not heavenly as some French roasts can be but rather a middling flavor. I do have to say there was no issue with acidity even when I used the package and used less water than I should have. Coffee taste is so personal and I'm sure you will get mixed reviews on this. I remember the first time I made a pot of French Roast at one job someone in accounting started to pour it down the drain saying it had \"gone bad\"!","2772":"We are coffee lovers, and my husband is a heartburn sufferer hence my excitement to try the Puroast Low Acid Coffee.  It wasn't horrible, but wasn't as good as we would have wanted.  It just didn't have that good coffee taste that we love.  If you don't like strong tasting coffee, then this might be okay for you, but it isn't for us.","2773":"The manufacturer of this Dark French Roast Coffee advertises that it is gourmet coffee with less than half of the acid found in regular coffee. This minimizes, they say, heartburn, acid reflux, and mild stomach irritation. They add that their coffee lacks \"the bitterness\" found in regular coffee. My wife and I tried the coffee and found no difference in taste between it and the regular store brand coffees.","2774":"I didn't like this coffee. It did have a good smell when I first opened the pack, but that is about it. I like a medium to strong flavor in my coffees and this was just plain weak. I guess if you have stomach problems or just like a light coffee this would be great, but anyone who likes alot of flavor won't like this.","2775":"I liked the strong aroma of this french roast coffee, both from the pouch and when it was brewing.  But the flavor was off, and it left a strong aftertaste.  I do get heartburn on occasion, and can say I did not have any after drinking this.  However, the price is so very high, and the flavor is only mediocre, so it is hard to recommend this product, unless you absolutely cannot drink regular coffee without distress.","2776":"Low acid or not, I'm sorry, I just couldn't get past the taste. I tried it black and w\/ additives - sugar, coffee-mate, etc..I had to draw the line at artificial sweeteners; they make everything taste worse... The brewing aroma was mild to nearly nothing --  depending on the strength it was brewed. Well, it looks like I'm stuck w\/ decaf during the work week until someone finds a low acid, great tasting coffee...","2777":"Tastes like coffee. A nice mild roast, which will not be to the tastes of those who want a bolder, maybe near burnt taste like Starbucks.  And this is very easy on the stomach. Of course that is because of they way it is ground, this is a very fine grind and quite frankly any fine ground coffee (even Espresso) is going to be easier and way less acidic and easy on your digestive system then a rougher grind.","2778":"I did not find this coffee to be any better than the brand that I usually use.  In fact, it gave me indigestion.","2779":"I was under the impression I was getting 10 packages of the puroast low acid coffee to try but only got one.  I made it and it was ok and the gerd did not act up that night but to be honest just having enough to try and use for one day would not convince me to give up my maxwell house for this, perhaps if I had more days and more samples my opinion would be different.","2780":"A little burnt, moreso than I like French Roast, I would put this more in the dark-Italian roast range. On the back side of flavor without much roundness, there is a little less body than perfect. Certainly the lack of acid is a major plus. On just the coffee taste, I'd give it three STARS.","2781":"I have tried many coffees, but never a low acid one.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  The aroma of the coffee after brewing was fine, but I felt that it tasted strong like a certain brand from Seattle.  And I don't like their coffee. For a dark French roast it tasted burnt to me.  On the other hand, my wife enjoyed it (and she is big fan of DD coffee).  I guess it goes to what each individual's taste is but to me this wasn't my cup of tea (pun intended).","2782":"I liked it but I didn't love it. It didn't have a strong flavor and it didn't seem rich. I usually drink Starbucks decaf French Roast and compared to this it seemed somewhat bland. But it wasn't bitter, and I could definitely tell it was low-acid, which is a great idea. I hope this company will keep trying to make some improvements to the formula, to give it more flavor. I very much appreciate their efforts. Mary Lee Moser, author, There and Back: A Journal Companion for Special Needs Parents.","2783":"I cannot say I had high expectations for a low-acid French roast coffee.  It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full-bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee.  It is not bad an certainly an alternative if you are susceptible to acid but it is not in competition for any premium coffee awards.","2784":"if you like coffee but don't want the acid.  this is a great coffee, the wife loved it and the dark roat.  me on the other hand like the acid and a lighter roast.  i'm not fond of dark roast.","2785":"Puroast didn't have that deep coffee smell when I first opened the package nor did it give off a rich smell as it brewed, that comforting scent that says \"wake up\".  The taste was ok at best.  As advertised it didn't bite back or cause acid reflux or heartburn.  I brewed it in a standard drip machine.  I'll be sticking to my usual brand of coffee rather than switching to Puroast.","2786":"I don't know what it is about anything w\/ caffeine in it that gives me such bad indigestion the past few years, but this stuff actually DIDN'T give me hot pipes!  I'm pretty much a plain black Dunkin Donuts snob and this flavor didn't didn't do anything for me.  It was drinkable, but wouldn't be my first choice again.  Decently strong, not the watered down swill I was expecting.  If you really need some relief from the gastric distress coffee can sometimes put you through, you wouldn't be wasting your money trying this out.","2787":"On a scale of one to ten, Maxwell House being a one and Gevalia being a ten this coffee tastes somewhere around three or maybe four at best. It claims to be a gourmet coffee but it sure doesn't taste that way to me. As for the acid level of the coffee since I'm on meds for the acid reflux there's no way for me to tell if it works or not. It claims to have less then 50% of the acid levels of regular coffee. For me 50% wouldn't do it. It would have to be acid free.","2788":"this coffee was made in a drip filter - i have to say that while the taste was not objectionable, it was not memorable... as far as the 'low acid' feature, i've never been affected by the acidity of coffee, and could not detect a lack of acidity in this brew...","2789":"This coffee has a taste I can't identify, nor describe, but I wouldn't buy this coffee again.  Perhaps if I had to use low acid coffee I'd buy more.  I added cream (something I don't usually use) and sugar and it wasn't that bad, but I'd rather have a coffee I can drink black - the way I like it.","2790":"This wasn't quite what I expected.  The coffee wasn't as strong as I like it even when I used 2 bags.  I could tell the difference about the \"low acid\" but it didn't make me want to go out and scream this is the best ever.  I could understand if the acid in coffee brothers you but for the 2 cup a morning mama I'm keeping my regular brand.","2791":"More like a slightly darker-roast version of standard office coffee. Thin body; not a true French roast flavor. It did seem to be less acidic.","2792":"While I wanted to try this coffee because of an acid reflex difficulty I was having for me personally it did not taste at  all like what I would call real coffee.  I've been used to drnking either Starburcks or Petts which I think have what you might call a robust flavor.  That may be the reason I was disappointed in this.","2793":"Taste is OK.  But I still prefer my cold brewed coffee's flavor.  Plus the cold brewed coffee has a lot less acid.  Costs a lot more than regular too.","2794":"I like low acid coffees for the reduced bitterness, as I dont general have acid-induced stomach problems. This coffee was very smooth and had little to no bitter taste - great features of a dark roast.  However, the flavor was not as deep or rich as I would expect from a gourmet French roast. It was pleasant, but I prefer a slightly more robust, complex flavor in a dark roast.","2795":"I'm a big coffee drinker...so the low acid is really a good idea.  This product was good...somewhere in the middle between Folgers and Starbucks I think. I can't say it was so good that I want to only drink his brand...but it will be remembered as one of many good coffees I've had.","2796":"This is pretty decent coffee. Not the best, but if you have acid problems it helps a lot! After drinking this, I had less acid burn in my esophagus.","2797":"My husband is a coffee drinker.  He finds this coffee just ok...nothing great.  For those who needs low acid coffee, this is probably not a bad choice.","2798":"Maybe they just had the roaster a little too hot that day, but our beans were slightly burnt. That being said, I can see (taste) the blend's potential. I'm no connoisseur, but I have my preferences. This blend was ok...not good, not great, just okay.","2799":"This coffee is really, really delicious, quality-tasting and fresh, but it does NOT wake me up.  Doesn't seem to have much caffeine.  If I drink some in the afternoon before work, I notice no difference in energy.  I just found out today that there is actually more caffeine in light roast coffee, so I'm gonna get Starbucks Breakfast Blend.","2800":"Taste and texture are OK. Prep is a little complicated. Lots of packaging that is apparently not recyclable... These are good for variety or to keep around 'just in case'.","2801":"I bought this as a gift for a friend whose dog likes these things.  My dogs won't eat them at all; I hand them to the dogs and they immediately spit them out.  At $6.19 per pound I hope my neighbor's dog likes them A LOT.","2802":"This is an OK product for occasional use but not something that adds much to the preparation or improvement of the meal.  The pork chops were adequately crisp on the outside, moist and tender inside and the coating added a blandly salty and vaguely processed flavor.  I did not use gigantic pieces of meat and barely had enough to coat 4 chops.  It is cheaper, easier, more versatile and healthier to toss together my own ingredients for chicken or pork.","2803":"This is a pretty standard shake and bake with no shaking bag in the package. I used a Ziploc bag instead. The seasoning was OK; that is no clumping. I used this product with chicken breast and it baked fine and there were no soggy spots on the meat. The flavor is fine but if you are looking for  something with a bold flavor or spicy, you may consider looking for another product.","2804":"The product was recently reformulated and, IMHO, isn't as good as it was.  The box states it has black tea, honey and vanilla & spices.  The envelope containing the chai mix states honey, black tea & spices.  Used to contain dried black tea and now contains instant black tea.  Don't know if the instant black tea made the difference, but now it has a disagreeable after-taste that it didn't have before.","2805":"I love this brand of chai mix, but the same product at Walmart is 42 cents per packet compared to 62 cents here.","2806":"The bearS were great and the thought an concept was excellent what brought the rating down for me were the treats.  They were reported to me as being not that good","2807":"I can't think of a product that Newman's Own makes that I don't like.  This is probably the closest.  Perhaps a more refined palate of a coffee connoisseur would disagree, but I find this coffee to be disappointing.  To be sure, it is \"extra bold\", but I also think it tastes extremely earthy.  I can't recommend it, but if you like bold, strong blends, it might be more to your liking.","2808":"I don't know why these are so expensive here, but they cost much less on Keurig's web site, or you can get a really large box of with twice as many at costco for the same price as Amazon. Usually Amazon has great deals, but this is really surprising! These are my favorite of the k-cups....I keep coming back to them.","2809":"I've tried both versions of Pistachio Jell-O (with and without sugar). I understand eating the sugar-free version for health reasons, but it's sadly lacking, and not just because of the lack of sweetness.  The regular version: -Is thicker (more like a custard) -Has a stronger pistachio flavor -Has more actual pistachio bits (the sugar-free version has maybe 1\/4 as many)  Either way, pudding is a great comfort food if you're looking for a tasty snack.","2810":"First, it's really NOT suited for use with a french press despite comments that it is fine for that application.  Second, it only tastes okay.  Third, it's 30% less in my local grocery store.  Overpriced on Amazon to say the least.","2811":"We have three large dogs.  One of our English Pointers has trouble with periodontal disease.  Bright Bites are recommended by VOHC, so decided to give them a try.  I bought the spearmint and the cinnamon flavors.  Our Greyhound will eat them, but neither of our Pointers will even touch them.  For me, the expensive dental treats are a waste. AL","2812":"I've enjoyed several of the Bar Harbor fish and shellfish soups and thought highly of them. As such, I thought I'd try their New England Style Corn Chowder. It was good. I enjoyed it. But, for the same price, I'd prefer their fish and shellfish soups' The sodium content is way to high, in my estimation, and then they say you can add salt if you like. This was an acceptable soup, but I probably won't buy it again.  Gary Peterson","2813":"I was shocked when I opened a can of this and saw what it looked like. It is VERY dry in the can.  Of course I was stuck with 6 cans so I've been using it to add to homemade soups and it works fine for that.  I never did eat it as a bowl of corn chowder.  So it is edible but it is way over priced and if I had only bought one can, I would never have bought more.","2814":"These tasted like potatoe stix, that we got in grade school with our lunches usually on pizza day.  They were the bomb then, not so much now.  Won't buy again unless I get them for cheap or free.","2815":"These chips are unusual and they do \"grow\" on you. The taste is most like shoestring potatoes, of which I am boderline addicted. I would order these again, but they are just too salty for my taste. I ordered the plain, so I don't know if the other flavors are also salty.","2816":"I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience. I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.  I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.","2817":"I tried the BBQ first and was pleasantly surprised.  I have always had a weakness for Sour Cream & Onion so figured it would be heaven in the popchips calorie sized bags..  And it arrived and just didn't have the same 'tang' as most SC&O flavors do.","2818":"I order these chips on a regular basis.  I like how they are portioned and one bag is only 2 points if you're doing Weight Watchers.  My last order however, arrived at my house in an open box with a huge amount of tape.  This resulted in me getting a case of crumbs.  I was very disappointed because usually they come in safe packaging. I give the chips 5 stars, but the packaging this time around was horrible!","2819":"While the chip is still light and crispy the flavor is off. It does have a nice little kick to it, but to me it tasted more like pickle than jalope&ntilde;o. I think they should be called \"pickle chips\"","2820":"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.","2821":"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.","2822":"These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole.","2823":"These chips are a great idea! Nice potato flavor with a satisfying crunch. But . . . . waaaaaay tooooo salty. I literally had to blow off the salt to be able to taste any potato flavor! I've tried the 'sour cream and onion' flavor, and that was fine. Just too much salt on the 'regular' flavor.","2824":"i usually love spicy chips... but somehow don't find these appealing... next time i think i will try the plain ones first! these are light and crunchy...","2825":"I love Pop chips- have tried many flavors and enjoyed them due to the low calorie count and they satisfy my craving for salt! With that said, I was so excited when I heard Pop Chips had come out with a Jalapeno Chip! I am sad to say the Jalapeno chip just misses the mark. Both my husband and I agreed there is something off about them and seeing as we usually love other kinds of jalapeno chips, these were just not good. Save your money, don't get the jalapeno chips flavor.","2826":"I really didn't care much for this flavor or should I say \"lack of\" flavor.  I bought a case of bar-be-que also and they have much more taste.","2827":"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.  Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!","2828":"i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip","2829":"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.","2830":"I've tried some of the other pop chips flavors - and they have MUCH more flavor. My kids, however, absolutely love these and since they're so much healthier than potato chips (I hope) I'll probably just continue ordering them.","2831":"I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ.","2832":"Normally I prefer plain chips, even though I don't eat them often. The chili lime is pretty good, great with some guacamole. These chips are very crisp, with a strong potato flavor, but also have a slightly burnt taste.","2833":"I used to think these were basically \"potato crack\" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order.","2834":"BBQ was out-of-stock when our subscription order was due, so I tried these. Still light and less fatty, but the flavor is off.","2835":"I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.","2836":"I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great. One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.","2837":"I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure, but I don't think I will buy it again.","2838":"They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor.","2839":"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again.","2840":"I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.","2841":"Amendment - Still GREAT - BUT Just reordered - 45% increase since May 12 - 45% is NUTS - Product GOOD but 25.00 to 36.00 ! ! WOW NOT a GOOD WOW  Great love them - the only place can now find is here ! Most stores changing to other versions - something good they have to change - long shelf life -  but they will never make it.","2842":"Mixed reviews for this product. Some people liked it very much, some of them hated it. When i first tried it, they tasted horrible. But somehow I liked it when i had them the next time. Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!","2843":"I normally love Popchips.  I couldn't find them in the local stores so I ordered them here.  The flavor doesn't seem as good... they are a little more browned,thinner and seemed more crispy in a harder sort of way.  I don't know if the batch was off or if they have changed how they make them.  I was disappointed.","2844":"Pop chips are great but you really have to be a garlic lover to enjoy this one as a snack.","2845":"The seasoning is too heavy. I will eat them, but only because I ordered a bunch.","2846":"I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.","2847":"Although it is very high in protein, I thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland. I would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough.","2848":"Which could be grand for some yet I had hoped for more.  I will keep searching for the coffee and tea enhancer of my dreams.","2849":"i have been buying starbucks syrup for so long which i have enjoyed, but thought that there might be something better out there, but i was disappointed to find that this product did not live up to its description and my expectations.  i found it to taste pretty artificial and it does not really enhance the taste of my coffee.  unfortunatly only ok.","2850":"I love the taste, but on reading the name and ingredients, I'm perplexed. The name touts \"honey-roasted peanuts\" but honey is not listed as an ingredient.  There are a lot of sugars, no wonder they taste good. I will probably keep eating them, but what ever happened to truth in advertising?","2851":"The presence of cinnamon makes the chips softer and kind of soggy. The taste is good and cinnamon is good addition, but I perfer the crisp non-cinnamon version.","2852":"I remember eating Shake 'N Bake when I was a kid. I think I even got the privilege of shaking the ole Ziploc baggie. I recently tried the Original Chicken flavor. I think the individual serving packs are great size. I even tried this on Tilapia tonight and it was pretty good. It's a great alternative to fried foods. I like that it is a really quick and easy meal solution. It takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish.","2853":"It's Shake n Bake...I doubt anyone is unfamiliar with this product.  It's okay, but I I'd prefer some flavor, seasoning in the mix, but it gives the meat a nice crunch.  Simple to use.  It says it's for chicken, but we used it on fish as well.  There's not much else I can think of to add.","2854":"The taste is very good, but I would think a microwave product would be more convenient. I didn't heat the sauce, just poured it over the rice.","2855":"I was like, wow whatta huge package of tea!  when it arrived.  The taste is good.  I like plain dark tea, iced.  The flavor is nice.  I would like the ingredient list to specify what kind of black tea it is exactly, but I do believe it's organic and it tastes good.  I appreciate Paul Newman is helping kids with my purchase.","2856":"Someone here mentioned that this tea is \"more pleasing to the palate than your average bagged tea\". Actually this is the exact reason why I don't like it. It's too mild for my taste. Tea should have a distinct flavor, but sadly this black tea doesn't. I wonder if any of the delighted reviewers of this product ever had a cup of really good black tea. Probably not, because this product essentially makes a cup of slightly tea-flavored boiled water.","2857":"Good product, but our dogs prefer some of the other ones out there.  Recommended, but not as highly as other products","2858":"Just received my order yesterday. Four bags of tea, all with a \"Best used by\" date of Jan. 8, 2012. That's less than three weeks from now.  According to Yamamotoyama's quality assurance department (I called them), the tea is 1-1\/2 years old.  This is old tea and it's going back to Amazon.  UPDATE: Tried to return it and Amazon has a \"no returns\" policy for this item.  Thanks Amazon!  UPDATE: I contacted Amazon customer service and they issued a refund to me. Upped the rating to 3 stars for the prompt customer service.","2859":"I am a bit disappointed. If I had to choose again I would have purchased the Palacios brand. It has a better taste, and better consistency. This one is Cantimpalo style, but not close to Cantimpalo at all. I would call it Chorizo Mediocre instead of Superior. I wish I could say something better, but I did not like it.","2860":"This is the best alternative to feeding your dog a natural raw diet. But it is WAY over priced. You can make your own raw diet for less than $1 a pound. Sorry but $10+\/lb is not a good bargain. You can buy human grade cuts of raw fresh meat for WAY less than that. Even Lamb. Good philosophy, not practical.","2861":"The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere.","2862":"This granola is quite tasty but is very soft. Granola for me needs to be crunchy not chewy even if it is gluten free. I haven't found a better alternative yet but will not be purchasing this brand again.","2863":"Great to have for breakfast or as a snack with yogurt! Mom loves it for her gluten sensitivity. Would also reccomend to anyone with similar issue!","2864":"We tried this because my son loves enjoy life triple berry GF granola. And I liked the fact that it had extra fiber, but he didn't care for it too much. I love pretty much all bakery on main products, but I wish they made just a honey or type of granola without nuts, for kids","2865":"Like a previous reviewer, I, too, am concerned over the product being made in China. It looks like a very healthy product and my dog loves it but I only care to feed my dog US-based products so that I can ensure the high quality that he deserves.","2866":"My dog loves everything about these Dog Treats. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0017TONPG\">Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Duck and Sweet Potato Dog Treats, 16-Ounce Reseal Bag<\/a> The order was delivered in a timely manner, in excellent shape.  The only downfall is I found the same thing at my local grocers for $5.00 less, after the fact :(  Other than that, it was a good purchase, but, needs to be cheaper to stay competitive.  I will do my homework next time to make certain of the cost.","2867":"I did a search for treats made in the U.S.A. these came up.  Are they made in the U.S. or not???","2868":"While my family really enjoyed the country ham, they were not fans of the bacon at all. It had a little bit of hard\/rubbery texture, even though it was cooked in the oven. We prefer a thick cut bacon that reminds you more of \"meat\". This cooked up more like a jerky. The flavor of the bacon wasn't there either, just didn't seem \"right\". Thought the price was a little high for what you got as well.","2869":"These bones splinter extremely easily for Medium to Large Dogs!  I would only give them to Toy or small dogs and with careful supervision.","2870":"We made the biscuits per the box recipe and they were tasty and eased my bread craving.  I did pay the full price 20-something listed here on Amazon and it's half price at another website which specializes in low carb food.","2871":"This item does make fairly good baked goods but not worth the high price in my opinion.  Does not compare with regular baking four at all though.","2872":"It's really expensive and doesn't taste all that good.  The cheddar biscuit recipe is about the only thing that was edible that I could make.  I have a box that's been sitting untouched in the pantry for the past year.","2873":"taste not bad. I added cinnamon and nutmeg for pancakes. They were flat and not fluffy.","2874":"These dried peaches were not too bad, but when compared to dried apricots, which I love, I would have to say they were a little over-dried. I had to chew them for a long time before I could swallow them.  I actually bought them to use is a recipe for peaches and cream cookies I saw on the food channel.","2875":"because i enjoy this manufacturer's dried apricots and plums so much, i thought i would give the peaches a try; however, i was disappointed.  they were not all sweet, and some of them were so dry they were hard to chew.","2876":"\"Van Houtte Cr&egrave;me Brul&eacute;e Coffee\" is OK once in awhile, but I wouldn't buy it on a regular basis. 3 stars.  \"Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee\" is a notch above this one.  But I recommend \"Van Houtte Cafe, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast) Coffee\", it's not flavored, but it's my favorite right now.","2877":"This selection was somewhat of a disappointment. The taste was good but it could have been a little stronger to suit me. The flavor is just a little too subtle.","2878":"The coffee is good but I think that the creme brulee flavor is lacking....","2879":"recently tried the choc raspberry k cups.  I am not fond of the flavor.  It smells delish, but, definately not enough chocolate flavor for me.  I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup, along with a bold coffee, I get the desired flavor that I enjoy.  For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor, the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent. Thank you.","2880":"A sample of these Van Houtte \"French Vanilla K-Cups\" were included with my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000AQPMHA\">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System<\/a> and, sadly, it was fairly disappointing. This seems to be a \"hit-or-miss\" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.  When made on the \"Large Cup\" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.  CFH","2881":"I drink my coffee black and like some flavor now and then, but with this I need to add cream and sugar to enjoy it.  But, when I do add creamer, it is very nice.","2882":"Good coffee just not my style.  I gave it a try with the reviews but it's not for me.  I would give it 5 stars for the aroma!!","2883":"I have liked all of the Van Houtte Kcups I have tried; except this one. Though the coffee wasn't bad in itself, I could not detect and vanilla flavor at all. Though this blend was smooth and had little to no bitterness; I expected a vanilla like flavor and detected none.","2884":"I actually thought I was buying the Van Houtte vanilla coffee k-cups that I usually purchase and I overlooked the description of \"light.\" It certainly is. You can barely taste the vanilla. It's good coffee, but if you're looking for a real vanilla flavor, go with the Van Houtte k-cups that are in a darker yellow package.","2885":"Nothing was truly 'wrong' with this, it's just that there was very little Creme Brulee flavor that I could detect. These Keurig cups aren't cheap, so I expect them to live up to their description.","2886":"The title says it all, the flavor is just ok, no real OOOOO factor. It doesn't really taste like creme brulee, for those who know that that tastes like. It's kind of caramel-ish with a burnt aftertaste, not my favorite. We're stuck with a whole extra box that we'll probably only drink when we're desperate. If you want a GREAT cup of dessert coffee go with Timothy's German Chocolate Cake, you wont be disappointed!","2887":"I love bold strong flavors and this is not quite there.  The raspberry fragrance is fantastic!  The chocolate is not present in the taste or the fragrance.  If smell alone will suffice or you like mild coffee, this one is for you.","2888":"A while back, I ordered this product, and when it arrived I found that the coffee was a \"Light\" blend. The coffee was good, however, I prefer a medium blend coffee. This time when I ordered, I checked the listings closely, and noted that this coffee was listed as  \"Medium\". To make a long story shorter, the coffee arived, and it is a \"Light\" blend again. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice and shame on you. I will not reorder it again.","2889":"This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle, but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.  I fill all four compartments up with kibble.  I holds about 2 cups of food, and it extends eating time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes.  Which means less gas for my dog and sweeter air for me.","2890":"while a great idea my 2 puppies are scared to death of this thing.  hopefully in the future it will change.","2891":"This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow \"cups\" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else.","2892":"It's a good feeding mechanism for my dog who scarfs food, but as far as a toy that challenges her, it's a cakewalk.  It's a great start for Kyjen to start marketing to people that love Nina Ottoson but don't want\/can't spend $40 on one toy.  I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.","2893":"clearly the more expensive puzzle games may offer more, but for what you pay, this is nice.  My dog enjoyed it, and caught on after a try or 2.  at first she took the yellow cover and ran... thinking that was the prize, but i called her back to show her the treats, and then it was on!","2894":"Nice product, but just too easy for all three of my dogs. The compartments are fairly small - so this would be best for a medium to small dog. This might be a great thing to use if your dog eats too fast... you could put their meal in all the compartments.","2895":"My toy poodle was quite interested in this toy, but it proved difficult for him to play with.  He has a small mouth and it was hard for him to pick up the yellow pieces to get at the treats.  It was also hard for him to rotate it on its base to expose the other treats.  I think this is a fine toy for bigger dogs, but Liam is only 7.7 lbs.  My husband also didn't like all the noise.","2896":"My dog loves this product and it didn't take him long to figure it out.  Which is the issue.  I don't really know if it works his brain much since he has it mastered...","2897":"It is fun for my toy poodle, but the yellow \"caps\" are too large for him to get his mouth around to remove them. He does enjoy moving the \"cover\" around so he can retrieve the treats.","2898":"This is a good product, my dog opened the doors twice and found the treat.  After the second time she just picked the toy up and turned it upside down till the treats fell out.  For a small dog it might work better","2899":"No seriously, she is.  My dog's \"grandfather\" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift. I videotaped it - 1st time, 23 seconds, including eating 4 treats.  She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles!","2900":"This product is so light weight. It is easily tipped over. The plastic is not very heavy and if the dog is very rough with it at all, the doors can snap off, even break off which was the experience that I had with the first one I owned. I would not recomment this product.","2901":"My dogs have enjoyed this toy but they lift a flap and try to rotate to toy to get the treats versus lifting each individual flap. Sometimes they get one or two treats then lose interest.","2902":"I am a diabetic and for a \"carba-nada\" product 4 ounces blew my blood sugar through the roof.  I still give the product a 3 because the taste and texture is quite good - for a non-diabetic!!!  My wife and family eat it.","2903":"I love that this is high protein, high fiber, low carb. Great nutritional content, and much cheaper than the grocery store. I have purchased this pack of 6 twice. I would give the first order 5 stars, but I give this order 2 stars. The reason: the second order was well within the expiration date, but has a musty smell. It tastes ok, but even after being cooked still has a musty smell. I will probably order again, but maybe try a different seller. In sum, I would recommend this product, but the quality was not consistent.","2904":"My Dog loves them but the only thing that bothers me is they only last about 10 to 15 min.And they are a little pricey.","2905":"I've ordered the two container straws twice and I should have stayed with that.  These are okay, but they have a weird taste when you first bite into it.  Takes a few seconds before it tastes like the straws.  I won't be buying these again.","2906":"You'd be surprised what you can do with a three foot gummy worm! IT FEEDS A LOT OF KIDS! You can have a ton of fun with it.","2907":"The cylinder-shaped pieces are easy to break, so are probably very easy to chew.  My puppy got tired of this after a week, and is refusing to eat it.  Luckily I had another brand and flavor of puppy food given to me at the vet.","2908":"I love snow balls and Hawaiian Shaved Ice sells good flavors...I've bought a few.  But the Pina Colada Snow Cone Syrup is a little too sweet.  Please understand that the taste is good but it needs to be watered down a bit.  So far, this is the only flavor that I found to be a bit too sweet.  I will definitely buy from this merchant again, however, I think I'll pass on the Pina Colada...for now.","2909":"I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.","2910":"I don't know if anyone else has trouble with the pull-tabs on these Canidae cans but I sure do.  The tab part is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well while trying to pull open the top.  I have almost cut myself several times.  End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull-top breaks off.  Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers.  But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason.","2911":"I didn't realize this food was ground up into a fine paste (rather than chunks), which my dog doesn't seem to like as much.  It also smells pretty bad.  That being said, it's high quality food which I have no concerns with.","2912":"This was quite a disappointment compared to the Idahoan potatoes I bought previously on Amazon. Very thin texture, flat taste, bland, will not get again.","2913":"I am not a huge fan of instant potatoes but these are better than many others on the market. They are quick and easy to fix when your running late and everyone seems to like them. Amazon makes it even easier by selling at a comparable price to the stores and shipping. It's nice to have them on hand when I'm rushed or unexpected guests show up and I need more in a hurry.","2914":"this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven","2915":"The gummy bear was not as big as I had expected it to be, but aside from that I am happy with this product.","2916":"OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat.","2917":"I love these almonds. They are my favorite to date and I would definitely buy again. The taste is crunchy, they are well toasted and the salt that has been added is just perfect. Not too little, not too much. Best I have ever eaten!!","2918":"I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.

It also smells pretty bad.  That being said, it's high quality food which I have no concerns with.","2921":"I originally bought these for my husband to throw in for his lunch. We then used it for the kids lunches a couple of times.  Kashi has gone down hill since they sold the company. When it was small it was good, healthy food. Now the sugar has crept in, and it is no better than sugar smacks.  We have it as a treat, not as a real food. So, they're good for last minute, not recommended for a real meal.","2922":"The items are tasty, unfortunately I developed hives  and intense itching after ingestion.  Never had allergic reaction to this type of food before but there's always a first.  After initial hive breakout I stopped eating the pastries and gave it a few days to see if it could be from other things.  The hives went away after a about five days and returned as soon as I ate the first piece after a week [they were refrigerated].","2923":"This is a good substitute for mayonnaise and sweet pickle when you're making tuna salad or chicken salad.  Gives you that sweet and creamy taste that makes those salads so good, but without the extra fat and sugar.","2924":"I was hoping that we would like this product more, however we just can't get over the texture. We found that it was easy to mix and made somewhat flat pancakes (we really like fluffy) Overall - I'd suggest buying one pack at your local store before springing for a pack of 4. On the other hand, the birds seem to LOVE this mix so I've been delighted to see them outside my window :)","2925":"The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot. The flavor is nice, and has a decent aftertaste. The texture is OK, but not what I would expect from a \"jerky\".. I would have preferred something much chewier. I did eat them, but it's not something I will purchase again.","2926":"... then these strips are for you.  A friend of mine introduced me to them, and admittedly, they taste pretty good, but the seitan has a color and texture that will make you think you are eating human flesh.  It's horrifying, and yet afterwards you'll be craving more, which is all the more horrifying.  So, 5 stars for taste, 1 star for cannibalism... 3 stars overall.","2927":"I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.  The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.  I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.","2928":"Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them.","2929":"Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.  This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.  It is OK. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not disgustingly bad or anything. Just know if you're looking for an alternative to jerky that this fails both the taste and texture test.","2930":"I bought this fudge expecting a more creamy fudge.  I was disappointed.  It has a strange undercooked grainy texture that I didn't like.  My canister was mainly rum raisin and that was my least liked flavor, it is made with real rum and I do not consume alcohol.  The ginger tasted odd and the strawberry didn't have any strawberry flavor.  I did like the Clotted cream it was very good, but only 2 in the pack.  I would not buy it again.","2931":"This tea tasted o.k. at best.  I live in a place where loose tea is available so it's not really worth ordering for me.  I probably will not buy this product again due to it's price.","2932":"This variety pack was supposed to contain Hazelnut DARK roast.  It didn't.  It only contained regular hazelnut, not as pictured or described at all.  Very disappointing, considering I bought this variety pack *just* to get the dark roast hazelnut.  Please fix the picture and description on this product, or send people the right product.","2933":"The coffee has decent flavor, but even in an 8oz cup, the coffee is a little on the weak side.","2934":"This came packed in 4 plastic bags inside a \"Bubble Envelope\". The weight of the entire package - unopened and undamaged - was 14.2 ounces. Don't know about China, but in the USA that's well short of a pound. Not going to bother with trying to get my money back, but you need to be aware of this.","2935":"I thought I wrote a review but it magically disappeared. Anyway, here it goes again. These peppercorns are okay but lack the punch of better ones I have had in the past. Those are hard to find though. You taste them in dishes like shuizhurou in authentic Sichuan restaurants, also hard to find.","2936":"Beautiful pink and reddish color, exotic scent, very floral.  I bought this to make a chinese pickled cucumber dish, but 8 oz. of this product is a LOT of product.  I ground them in my mortar and pestle as per the recipe, but the peppercorn shells stuck in my throat and made me cough.  Next time I will take the time to remove the shells afater grinding.","2937":"I completely liked these things --- BEFORE I got the gigantic 5lb bag. I'd actually prefer to keep them as a treat rather than something to just get sick of. After just a few, the taste gets worse and they are just way too gummy. I am already sick of them and have like 4.5 lbs left.  Too bad they didn't have the small bags in stock when I got these.","2938":"not what I expected, but not bad. The taste is fine, just very cloudy in appearance. I was hoping to find a \"clear\" green tea....maybe it just isn't out there.","2939":"I wasn't fond of the raspberry flavored green tea. It doesn't measure up at all to their original green tea. It wasn't absolutely horrible and I did end up drinking it, but I was disappointed since I am familiar with some of their other products. If you want fabulous green tea, try the original first.","2940":"With Subscribe and Save, these are about the same price as they are at the local Family Dollar so I went ahead and ordered a pack of 4 for myself and friends I have over for the holidays.  These are just average. I thought there'd be more to them. Very small layer of cheese but I guess that's about how everything is nowadays. But these are just average. I won't be purchasing them again.  They aren't bad if you used them in dip.","2941":"the product is not that bad, but it has  this weird bitter taste im gonna keep on using it, just for the zero calories. but if it wasn't for that i would never use it again.","2942":"like the softness, and it doesen't have that awefull aspartame crap in it. thats the one of the reasons I bought it.","2943":"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste.","2944":"This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.","2945":"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome.","2946":"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness.","2947":"These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin.","2948":"The first time I tried these, I thought, \"WOW!\" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige.","2949":"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.","2950":"These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.","2951":"I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!","2952":"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a \"low salt\" item.  They seem as salty as any \"regular\" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.","2953":"Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.","2954":"I have to admit I got pretty excited when I saw this as I've been desperate for a pork roll egg and cheese sandwich since moving from NJ to the DC Area, but all the reviews here just talk about their love for pork roll or unwillingness to pay for it? Has anyone actually ordered from this vendor? I'm seriously considering ordering this to fill my Jersey Breakfast void, but I do not want to spend $96 for pork roll if it gets delivered to me spoiled or something.","2955":"I was really hoping to use this as a substitute for brewed iced tea, but for me it isn't.  The taste is only fair and the powder doesn't completely dissolve.  I had been thinking I would add it to bottled water when away from home but I have decided to order some Ito En Green Tea, a bottled brewed green tea, from amazon for this purpose.","2956":"not what I expected, but not bad. The taste is fine, just very cloudy in appearance. I was hoping to find a \"clear\" green tea....maybe it just isn't out there.","2957":"I was not too impressed with this tuna.  It was ok.  I applaud the companies efforts and what they do.  I ended up giving 3 of my cans away.  I used the other 3 for  a meal.  I usually like tuna with oil, but I thought the flavor was lacking.  I think their other tuna canned in its own juices is much better.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002EY5TTW\">Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Albacore Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)<\/a>","2958":"I know it says they are long lasting but my two toy breed puppies made them disappear almost immediately. I would hate to see what a larger puppy could have done with them. Not so long lasting but they LOVED them! I am looking for a longer lasting treat to keep them busy in the morning when I crate them and leave for work. Any recommendations?","2959":"So I read another review before I bought these and saw that it turned things orange but was easy to get out.....not so for my light gray wool area rug.  I have used several carpet cleaners and there is still a slight stain on the rug---much smaller than what I started with, but it won't come out.  However, my German Shepherd puppy loved these things and eat them right up--however I won't be buying them again.","2960":"Douwe Egberts coffee is the most incredible coffee you will ever have, but only out of the machine that uses the liquid form. I was so excited about availability of ground but very dissapointed in the taste. It's ok but nothing like the machine. It doesn't change my opinion of the company and the amazing machine, but I'll just stick with Starbucks, Peet's, Seattle's, etc ground. As always though, Amazon is so easy to work with, I received my order quickly. Amazon never let's me down.","2961":"I'm kind of disappointed in this coffee. Touted to be so wonderfu.  Not all it's cracked up to be. First off the grind is too fine. Second, very hot water makes it bitter. Won't order it again. I wish I had been able to order just one box just to try it first, instead of having to order a set of three. I was looking to find the taste of the coffee in the restaurant. They should sell the liquid like they use in restaurants. What a tease.","2962":"Orangina is my favorite drink of all time, and i average at least a bottle a day, but $11.05 is an outrageous price for four glass bottle. If you go to any Trader Joe's they sell the same four pack for $3.98","2963":"I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang)","2964":"I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.","2965":"I just want to know, Is this Madhaya Organic Coconut Sugar 100% Coconut Sugar? The nutritional label as to what actually is contained inside this bag is not available and I read that even for products that claim to be Organic Coconut Sugar a mix of industrial sugar may have been added. Please, help. I no longer consume white sugar but substituted with dark honey but now I am reading that TRUE Organic Coconut Sugar w\/ no added fillers is the best option for sweetening the palate. Thank you! :)","2966":"My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint\/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat.","2967":"I used this syrup to mix in a Samoan Fog Cutter and the taste of plastic is SO overwhelming, I can't taste the orgeat! Don't really recommend this brand solely for the packaging; needs to be contained in glass to preserve the delicate taste. Would have been better otherwise.","2968":"I guess the reviews I read on this product hyped up my expectations.  I love spicy foods, but to me it was only mild.  It's still a good product though.","2969":"This is a Good product if eaten quickly. the taste was excellent. I was a little surprised at the quickness and totality of the mold that set in.  It is good if you eat all of it in 4 -5 days.","2970":"I should have picked up on the MSG before I ordered the jerky. That's my fault.  The jerky tastes OK. It lacks in freshness and tastes salty in a less than favorable way. Also, in true MSG fashion, the jerky leaves you craving more even when your last bite was not particularly amazing.  I'm torn between two stars and three stars. I think I'll stay at three.","2971":"The others like it a lot and I think the taste is good, but the texture is just off to me. Its very soft and tender, but kind of crumbly. I prefer the honey pepper. Not too spicy, either, so that's nice. Over all its ok and the others in the office will buy more, but I will stick to the other kinds.","2972":"I've been hunting for the intensely flavorful creation I found at a roadside stand several years ago. This has a nice flavor but does not have the intense flavor or texture I've been searching for.","2973":"Great product but this vendor is selling it about 30% more than you can get it at a Target or Babies Rus. Convenience isn't worth that much.","2974":"We got the 6 pack of brown rice and it smell very strange, almost like rancid nuts. I did TONS of research to find out this was normal or if the cereal really was rancid. I opened several cans and they all smell the same. Other people had the same experience, and apparently the smell is normal. My 7 month old daughter seems to like it and her poos have gotten softer, constipation had been an issue before :( Three stars because it smells and tastes very strong.","2975":"I love the product, but I think that it is a bit too pricey. The cans are barely over half full so we go through them very quickly. Like I said, I love the actual cereal, but if it wasn't the only cereal my baby could eat I wouldn't buy it because of the price.","2976":"They look nice, but taste is bland and feel is rubbery. I simply satue'd them with onions in oil for 15 min on low heat until they became golden brown. The smaller pieces are tasty but big ones are very tough. I have not tried them in stong sauces, but no far it's dissapointing","2977":"One of the main reasons I purchased this specific product was because it says it has red in it.  The package, itself, states \"red\" as one of the colors.  Of the 36, there was not a single red.  The majority of the package was pink.  Very disappointing.  So unless you are looking for pink, I would shop elsewhere.","2978":"I tried this because you could not get any more of mrs. leepers and I found that in my opinion, mrs. leepers is a better rice pasta.","2979":"I ordered these based upon the reviews here and the fact that it seemed like a bargain.  Unfortunately, I was not as pleased as I expected to be.  I found the flavor to be kind of bland and the texture to be rather mushy compared to other brands that I have tried.  They aren't terrible.  But they aren't great either.  Next time, I'll try a different brand.","2980":"If your toddler is a good eater, these are a very good deal price wise. I paid $3.29 for one at my local store.  That said, my granddaughter will not eat the chicken bits. I tasted them and ...not so hot! She eats the veggies and mashed potatoes and that is it. She is somewhat a picky eater but I am not sure it is her problem. I didn't like the chicken either.","2981":"I like mint tea and bought 2 packs of 3. First pack were good but when I started second pack seems like I was drinking different tea, taste was awful,no mint but kinda dust taste.Cannot finish that pack. Not buying anymore.","2982":"I got this in the mail in this tiny box and thought \"this couldn't possibly be the gift box i ordered\", well it was. It was very well packaged, and it looked delicious, there just wasn't very much to it.","2983":"Hoping it would taste just as good and the MJB Columbian, I was very disappointed int the decaf. Shipping was very fast & I really appreciated that, along with the price. I'd recommend Sam's decaf as it is columbian. Still, put this into jars with an oxygen pack and will store it for emergencies.","2984":"Before purchasing this product I had read that it was close in taste to Lavazza...which is lighter in taste and not bitter at all. This particular blend is quite bitter and I did not find it to be \"smooth\" like the description states. This is probably perfect for those of you who enjoy a dark and bitter roast...but for those who want a light smooth espresso without bitterness...I wouldn't recommend it...It really just comes down to preference.","2985":"I was a little amazed that the product states to cook for 10 minutes. I have never known a navy bean to cook in 10 minutes.  My soup cooked for 50 minutes before the beans were done. I added some carrots, onion and ham. With a side of cornbread with honey butter, A great meal for a cold, wintery nite.","2986":"Guys, do you know what \"malossol\" means in Russian? \"Lightly salted\". This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit. Other than that its a very good tasting caviar (I guess you can blame a puddlefish for that), very close to Russian Sturgeon's caviar.","2987":"I have bought these twice now. The first order was great, great flavor, crunchy, very fresh tasting. I was so impressed I quickly ordered a second batch. Since the first were so fresh, I figured they'd last awhile.  The second batch was bad. Stale and not very crisp with a sort of mild chemical taste rather then that nice cheesy flavor. I had a hard time believing they were even the same product. I'm eating them slowly because I generally don't believe in wasting food that is edible, but I hesitate now to try other things.","2988":"They were good but all the boxes were pretty much crushed. Maybe thats why I got 4 boxes for a cheap price.","2989":"Did not meet expectations.  I really, really love tea. Even when using 2 bags, there was very little chocolate flavor, if any at all.  The Hot Cinnamon Spice and the Earl Grey Supreme is a different story. I've tried most of the H&S teas, most of which are wonderful. This is among my least favorites as I enjoy most of their varieties however this one was disappointing. If you ever try the Green tea with coconut you must add honey and lemon and WOW major flavor explosion...without those condiments its very mild. Just a tip.","2990":"I was expecting the beef stick to be like one of the pictured multipacks with a natural looking sausage type snack that is a little thick.  Instead, these individually wrapped sticks are very long but small diameter.  As such, much of the texture is the casing and not the meat.  I also wish the Original flavor was a little more peppery.","2991":"What I thought I ordered were 24 Decaf Donut House K Cups.  What I received was a variety of K cups not all Decaf. This description was misleading.  I cannot drink caffeine.","2992":"This is great tasting coffee, especially for decaf, BUT I couldn't believe there was only 1 packet of 24.......my mistake, there are usually 50 or more, I didn't read through the description......I will buy this again if the price comes down.","2993":"This jerky is okay at best unless you're salt fanatic.  I'm a heavy salter, but this stuff is over the top...","2994":"Okay, so call me stupid, but I was searching for small packs of jerky for lunch snacks and saw this one advertised as 36 count.  I actually thought I was going to get 36 individual oz or less packages of beef jerky.  Imagine my surprise when I got one 15oz package (not even a pound) for $36 plus shipping.  I hope the taste and texture is worth it!","2995":"My dogs didn't like these as well as other Smokehouse products.  They much prefer the chicken tenders or the duck and sweet potato treats.  They still liked them, but just didn't appear as excited as they do with the others","2996":"Product arrived quickly but was smaller than it looked as pictured on the web site.","2997":"This is just for my taste, it may be perfect for you since it is not as strong as pure ginger itself.  If you think pure ginger is too strong, then go for this product, otherwise this is too light.","2998":"I was disappointed.  My first order was for the granola pancakes and they were fabulous!  So when these went on special I grabbed a case trusting the brand and can barely make it through the first can. Strange taste and nothing like I expected but still edible and got on a special so what can I say...will finish but not repurchase.","2999":"I found nothing bad with this mix, bit there is no \"zing\" in the taste that will cause me to re-order.","3000":"I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.","3001":"This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.","3002":"Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.","3003":"I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red\/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.","3004":"This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!","3005":"This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!","3006":"Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too","3007":"This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.","3008":"One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.","3009":"good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!","3010":"The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.","3011":"My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.","3012":"I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.","3013":"Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.","3014":"My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.","3015":"I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also. There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)<\/a>","3016":"I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.","3017":"I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it.","3018":"I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM! Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.","3019":"Product received is as advertised.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)<\/a>","3020":"I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener. Great deal for the price.","3021":"I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets. These are just EXCELLENT!","3022":"I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!). The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee\/Latte\/Cappuccino\/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)","3023":"This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.  Staral","3024":"This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.","3025":"Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.  McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)","3026":"McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)  I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.","3027":"For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!  Thanks, Abby","3028":"What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!","3029":"I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  She's happy, I'm happy!!! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001EO5QW8\">McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<\/a>","3030":"I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box. It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy","3031":"McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.","3032":"We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often. This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient. Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.","3033":"Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.","3034":"I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.","3035":"Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..","3036":"I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.","3037":"We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1\/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.","3038":"Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.","3039":"It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.","3040":"Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!","3041":"Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.","3042":"This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy","3043":"This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride. I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation. I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.","3044":"This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.","3045":"this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault","3046":"These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10\/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!","3047":"I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.","3048":"These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.","3049":"These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!","3050":"i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp.","3051":"This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!","3052":"Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them.","3053":"We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems. I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.","3054":"My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.","3055":"My shepherd\/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!","3056":"Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. \u00cet's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!","3057":"I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.","3058":"This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.","3059":"This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)","3060":"This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.","3061":"I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger\/smaller sized dogs.","3062":"Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food. This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.","3063":"My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).","3064":"The mouth says, \"How do I love thee, let me count the ways...\" If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy.","3065":"Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.","3066":"The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour\/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.","3067":"These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!","3068":"What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.","3069":"I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!","3070":"I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!","3071":"I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!","3072":"I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.","3073":"this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...  great delivery...again quality... just try it...","3074":"I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!","3075":"I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.","3076":"I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.","3077":"In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!  Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!","3078":"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.","3079":"This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.","3080":"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.","3081":"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!","3082":"One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.","3083":"Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!","3084":"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.","3085":"I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!","3086":"Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.","3087":"I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.","3088":"Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.","3089":"i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon","3090":"I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.","3091":"The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)","3092":"Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.","3093":"I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.","3094":"I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.","3095":"Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand. If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s\/h it's a good deal. The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there","3096":"I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them. Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!","3097":"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!","3098":"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!","3099":"This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.","3100":"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.","3101":"This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!","3102":"Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores","3103":"Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.","3104":"AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.","3105":"I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!","3106":"What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.","3107":"Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.","3108":"<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins  <\/span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so. edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.  I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna. I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.","3109":"I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.","3110":"these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato","3111":"I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.","3112":"I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.  I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!  I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.","3113":"I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)","3114":"Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!","3115":"I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag.","3116":"I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk. It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US, and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring back. Check it out.","3117":"I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!","3118":"One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.  I will continue buying it.","3119":"This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.  I will buy this product again and again.","3120":"Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.","3121":"This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!","3122":"Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.  I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.  Love this stuff.","3123":"I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.","3124":"This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!","3125":"This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.","3126":"We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.","3127":"My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It's tolerablel.","3128":"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)","3129":"This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma.","3130":"Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'","3131":"Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product. However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging.","3132":"These little guys are tasty and refreshing.  I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.  They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.  This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!","3133":"I like these better than the regular Altoids, but they're even more costly, so you'd better like them.","3134":"These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did.","3135":"Pros: +packaging, shipping, price +sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat\/share 9 boxes) +not too \"fresh\" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!  Cons: none!","3136":"These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.","3137":"This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.","3138":"I love, and use the empty containers for medicine\/advil in my purse, desk, suitcase. Also line with felt to keep earrings. Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints. Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth.","3139":"Received as shown. My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them. It was great i could get them on Amazon.","3140":"The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.  I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again.","3141":"I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review. The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion. I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them! Highly recommended!","3142":"Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.","3143":"Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]. The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious. Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say \"Wintergreen Me!\" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world.","3144":"Don't buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.  I can't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite.","3145":"I order these olives a lot. They are un-like any other olives out there. The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests.","3146":"I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too.","3147":"This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.","3148":"Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.  The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins.","3149":"I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy.","3150":"Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks. I use 1\/2 and1\/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar! Half mix ,half clamato!","3151":"Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste.  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand","3152":"I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long.","3153":"I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.  The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.  My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one.","3154":"i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience.","3155":"These things are huge! I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. This lemony flavor is my favorite--it's good on almost everything. You'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this.","3156":"This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock.","3157":"Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding.","3158":"I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot.","3159":"Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)","3160":"I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.","3161":"Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.","3162":"I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range. The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (it's easy). If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares?","3163":"Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered.  This was my second order and I'll be ordering this item again.","3164":"good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price","3165":"If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack.","3166":"These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect. Although I wasn't sure about the peanut butter bar, it was excellent. I loved the Roasted Almond, Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter.  I will definately buy from this seller again. Quick shipping and very fresh.","3167":"Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value.","3168":"These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesn't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product.","3169":"A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle, Rio. He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm.","3170":"I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much.","3171":"Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend!","3172":"Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.","3173":"It's just sugar in the raw, it's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it's suppose to be better for you or something. I just wish the bags were resealable.","3174":"This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer.","3175":"I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again.","3176":"This sugar is very good.  Use this in your coffee, cereal, etc for a week and you'll never go back to white sugar, white sugar will taste terrible.  Plus from what I've read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.  The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found.","3177":"I really love this sugar and price-wise it's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else.","3178":"Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as \"regular\" sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff.","3179":"Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service!","3180":"Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another \"binder\" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!","3181":"Best flavor ever!  I'm addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say....","3182":"So many \"healthy\" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.","3183":"I found these crisps at our local WalMart & figured I would give them a try. They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips, not that I was a big chip fan anyway. The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting. I give these crisps a big thumbs up!","3184":"This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten! I only buy it on special occassions because I know I'll eat the whole bag.","3185":"the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing!","3186":"I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!","3187":"I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!  I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.  I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.  If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try.","3188":"The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. It's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages. Yay!!!","3189":"I've tried 5-hour energy, red rain, NOS, and other energy shots.  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  Plus, it's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  Sometimes I wonder what I'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years.","3190":"If you're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters.","3191":"I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all, its also the best taste, others taste like medicine, this one has a tea fresh taste. I love it.","3192":"I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high & no crash. I'm on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. I've seen it over 2 bucks in the store.","3193":"Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink.","3194":"I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant.","3195":"I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots.","3196":"I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :)","3197":"You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!!","3198":"This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend","3199":"I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish, or add more and make a \"pasta type\" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare!","3200":"I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try.","3201":"I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both.","3202":"It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing.","3203":"service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)  Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade","3204":"Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week.  Love this product.  Fast shipping, as usual.  Would buy again.","3205":"These individually wrapped pieces are delicious (although I wish there were a few more). Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste, even a traditional \"marzipan-aholic\" should enjoy these.","3206":"Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit.","3207":"i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work.","3208":"These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!","3209":"Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D","3210":"This seller is very nice.  And the price is very good.  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them.","3211":"I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee \"tea\" bags.  They're great because they don't require refrigeration.","3212":"I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim.  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright \"thinking of you this spring\" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!","3213":"Yes, I am having a cup right now.  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend.","3214":"This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  It's perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma.","3215":"The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again!","3216":"I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Can't beat that its organic!","3217":"Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.","3218":"What a GREAT idea!!!! My daughter love it. I don't think is difficult to wash, I mean, is not like just toss water and that's it... but, come on!!!! Absolutely recommend it!","3219":"I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!","3220":"This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per...","3221":"I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!","3222":"\"These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter.\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00067AD4U\">Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds<\/a>","3223":"The product was exactly as advertised and fresh.  Unfortunately, I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast.  We need to reorder to keep up with \"demand\"","3224":"These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the \"bean\" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing.","3225":"Popchips are so good.  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal.  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence.  They taste so  good,","3226":"I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices.","3227":"The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles\/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls.","3228":"That's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes (puffs with small sugar pearls on top). Works great, yum!!","3229":"This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.","3230":"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)  This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).  For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.","3231":"Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands \"out there\" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again.","3232":"I hadn't tried (or heard of) till recently Weavers not it's my favorite. I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far.","3233":"Having always been a strict Peet's Coffee lover, I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver's won my heart!! The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart!","3234":"Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don't know better, take along a travel mug filled with Weaver's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe.  Er, Weaver's.","3235":"Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct \"coffee\" caramelish finish.  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet's and we are hooked !  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend, but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink. Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast.  Since them we are fans. You wont be dissapointed !","3236":"I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost. It has everything that I am searching for in a, \"To Go Snack\". Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing!!!","3237":"These are my favorite bars ever. The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful! Very filling! These are hard to find in the stores. I'm thankful for subsrcibe and save!","3238":"My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us don't carry them anymore!  Once again, Amazon came through and he couldn't be happier.","3239":"I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting, they make a great snack when I'm on the go. Chocolate, peanuts and raisins...it doesn't get any better.","3240":"Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school.  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so.  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores.  So again, Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price.  Now, I came keep the husband's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings.  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack.","3241":"\"Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites.  I was suprised that it was a single box.  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack.  My fault for not reading closer.  I will not order any more at this price for 1 (24 count)","3242":"Green Mountain \"Nantucket Blend\" K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000AQPMHA\">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System<\/a>. This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0029XDZIK\">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging<\/a>] I generally drink in the morning.  These are good on both \"Small\" and \"Large\" cup settings as well.  Highly Recommended!  CFH","3243":"Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak.","3244":"I was looking for a replacement for Timothy's Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon.  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice, but not strong enough for me.  If you like milder coffees, then this one is for you.","3245":"One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion,love it for your everyday blend, perfect stregnth, excellent blend!","3246":"This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont.","3247":"I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking,  I love the regular, I use it on everything. You won't be sorry you tired it, great for dipping bread and cooking omelet, and green beans.","3248":"Oh my gosh, is this good!  Like most people, I've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it.  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home.  The tomato flavor is amazing.  I will never buy store ketchup every again.","3249":"This is ridiculous.  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted.  It is pricey, but wow..love this stuff.  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup.  Yummy!","3250":"The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor.  It is clean and really fresh!  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich.  The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried.  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy!","3251":"I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used, including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA.","3252":"If you are a peanut lover, these are for you. Much larger than cocktail peanuts. Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year!!","3253":"Although there were several \"shriveled\" ones, they taste just fine.  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don't have to look perfect anyways.  For the price, they are a great deal (about half of what I find them for in the store)","3254":"These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.","3255":"I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I don't think freshness will be an issue, they won't last long......lol","3256":"Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldn't believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure.","3257":"This is a great ham soup base.  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans.  Great flavor","3258":"Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store. I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy. Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.","3259":"I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping. This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture. Thanks again amazon.","3260":"Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix.  It tastes great, cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make.  Although it can be made using water, I think it's better made with milk.  I love it with pure organic maple syrup.","3261":"The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son's egg allergy.  It's also great for camping or any time you'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available.","3262":"We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy. They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways!","3263":"A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!","3264":"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather. This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas. If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help. If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea. I highly recommend both.","3265":"This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better.","3266":"A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !","3267":"I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon.","3268":"i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market.","3269":"This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available!","3270":"It's always a pleasure to find French's products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.  This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.","3271":"If you like Oreo's or the Oreo cakester, then you've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters!!! These are the best!! Side note: shipping was very slow, but maybe your chances will be better.","3272":"I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!","3273":"Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!","3274":"These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.  I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all!","3275":"I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do. I like chocolate chip cookies well enough, but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones. I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients. The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies.","3276":"They aren't fattening and they're good for you, right? That's what I heard, at least, from an admittedly unreliable person.","3277":"Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard.","3278":"I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f\/the money!","3279":"I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10.","3280":"Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.","3281":"one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone. If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...","3282":"The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!","3283":"WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT.","3284":"Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.","3285":"I love Kettle Brand Chips! I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.  Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).  Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.","3286":"These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.","3287":"I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.","3288":"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.","3289":"These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.  I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).","3290":"I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them.","3291":"These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.","3292":"For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.","3293":"Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.","3294":"These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory.","3295":"Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!","3296":"Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.  Crunchy, real potato chips!","3297":"These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips.","3298":"This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.  Love it:)","3299":"My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!","3300":"The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree.","3301":"As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!","3302":"These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them!","3303":"Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon.","3304":"I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little \"portion control\". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!","3305":"these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE","3306":"Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.  Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service  Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.","3307":"We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit! Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live.","3308":"I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!","3309":"These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time!","3310":"These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!","3311":"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close.","3312":"They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.  On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.","3313":"It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.","3314":"These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving.","3315":"We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand\/flavor of chips. Very tasty!","3316":"These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!","3317":"These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected.","3318":"fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover","3319":"Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty.","3320":"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee.","3321":"I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.","3322":"Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.","3323":"These chips are quite tasty and the price is right.  Packaged very well, would buy again.","3324":"For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.","3325":"My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1\/2 the calories in fat, however.","3326":"Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there.","3327":"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.","3328":"We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.","3329":"A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , \"these will change your life!\"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you.","3330":"But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country.","3331":"i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them.","3332":"This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.  How can you go wrong?  Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food.","3333":"Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone. But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat very many. That makes them an indulgence that rescues some people from overindulgence.","3334":"I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast.","3335":"I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!","3336":"Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!","3337":"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is \"I like it.\"  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...","3338":"These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.  Enjoy.","3339":"These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would.","3340":"Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!","3341":"I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished... I don't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage, but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily, there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be.","3342":"TOTALLY ORGASMIC.  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted.  signed up for the subscribe and save option.  the case contained 15(FIFTEEN, FULL SIZED BAGS) OF CHIPS.  the price per unit equals $1.73  per package.  that is not even the cost of plain chips.  if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery, this deal is a steal.  so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS.  p.s.  even if you paid the going price of $30.00, you are still ahead of the curve.  ENJOY","3343":"Despite coming in an extremely large box, I found this to be great value. All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. I'd definitely recommend.","3344":"If you like spicy, then these are for you.  I like spicy, so I enjoyed these.  They're also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be.","3345":"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.","3346":"These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.  They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.  A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!  Enjoy!","3347":"I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :)","3348":"These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!","3349":"Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the \"hard-core\" Salt N Vinegar fans.","3350":"Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more; and using them, rather than corn chips, to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson. (But without any of the associated wardrobe risks. (-:) HIGHLY recommended.","3351":"These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.  The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier.","3352":"They are good but wish they were also baked. Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. If there are any I wish someone would post.","3353":"I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them.  The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful.  I would definitely make the purchase again.  THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich.","3354":"Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips.","3355":"My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked.","3356":"I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in.","3357":"After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!","3358":"I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.","3359":"These chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. Just don't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. They'll totally know it was you.","3360":"I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.  I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same.  You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!","3361":"I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.","3362":"This is a real good product.I love these chips and so does my customers can't go wrong wit these the best","3363":"I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. These are the only chips I eat","3364":"I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...","3365":"If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips. This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale. The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.","3366":"Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp.  I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor.","3367":"I have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous.  I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores.  They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt.","3368":"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.","3369":"Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard\/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.","3370":"These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.","3371":"Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.","3372":"Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.  The Product?  These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.  Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures.","3373":"If you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must try. Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno. Delicious. Addicting. Recommended.","3374":"This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!","3375":"How to achieve potato chip nirvana? It's simple:  Buy these chips, get them tomorrow, eat them! Repeat.  Why?  Best \"old school\" BBQ flavor out there Kettle quality Incredible price with Amazon  Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain?","3376":"I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. The New York Cheddar flavor is so good, you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag.","3377":"But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. Damn it! They should warn you about this! Tastes awesome though. When I finish my crash diet I will order another box (case?). :-)","3378":"I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible.  I didn't expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.  I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips.  The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open.  Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.","3379":"Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).","3380":"Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack.","3381":"I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares.","3382":"Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy.","3383":"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're \"kettle chips\" and they're \"fried\" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot\/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!","3384":"This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.  They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.  They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table.","3385":"These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.","3386":"These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!","3387":"Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.  There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.  This is an excellent product!","3388":"I agree with the company motto \"A Natural Obsession\".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.","3389":"The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.  I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.  Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips.","3390":"These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.  Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.","3391":"These chips were good. I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good. I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do.","3392":"these are the best chips out there.. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this.. once you eat it you wont stop..addicting stuff","3393":"At first I was thinking, \"cheese flavored chips?\"  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious.  The cheese is not overpowering.  They are yummy and crispy!!","3394":"I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store.  The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand.","3395":"We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.    Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.    How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.","3396":"For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less \"natural\" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.","3397":"Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. I don't care for the \"fancy\" flavors and these are salted just right. Thick, super crunchy and full of flavor, they are the best!","3398":"Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff. Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP. Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high.","3399":"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.  I reccomend them!","3400":"My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!","3401":"I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.","3402":"This kettle chips taste \"Good , Crispy & Crunchy \" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!","3403":"I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.","3404":"I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas. I have a cup every morning, very smooth refreshing tea.","3405":"The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well. The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right. The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush). Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes. A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.","3406":"Pros: - Extremely fragrant - Full bodied - Can be steeped twice - Nice air-tight container - Organic  Cons: - Price  The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted, and I would recommend it to anyone.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001EPPFGO\">The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)<\/a>","3407":"These biscuits are delicious, not too sweet, with just enough crunch.  We love them.  Quick delivery. We would order them again.  Very satisfied.","3408":"Excellent, lo-fat, lo- calorie treat for dogs. I have a German Shorthair Pointer-and these treats are her favorite( the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs, but she loves them-and for weight-control I like them!)","3409":"This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys.  It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure.","3410":"Love this with a bag of shrimp 3\/4 pound, some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped. Not too hot but very tasty.","3411":"We make up a coffee creamer with 1\/4 part commercial coffee creamer, vanilla, butter creme, almond and Bavarian Creme flavors and the rest milk.  It tastes wonderful and is half the price of store-bought!  It is excellent!","3412":"Good quality nectar.  Very tasty.  However, I was expecting 46 fluid ounces, not 46 ounces in weight.  I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces.","3413":"First time I've ever used Agave Nectar -- and it is great.  Keeps the blood sugar stable.  Great buy also!","3414":"This sweetner is the best, it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. And it has great health benefts.","3415":"I love this stuff.  It sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels.  Now if I could only figure out how to make tequila I would be set.  Just kidding.","3416":"I finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index. Agave is delicious! I have recommended it to many friends, and it is very economical to purchase the 46oz bottles.","3417":"I love using this to sweeten tea, coffee, etc. It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners - there is no bitter aftertaste.","3418":"I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes.","3419":"I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea, and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar.","3420":"I love this product! It is the best natural sweetener I have ever tried, and I have tried many. You can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich. It last a long time, and is a good value.","3421":"I have been using Agave Nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home. Madhava Agave Nectar is good tasting, it was a good buy!","3422":"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon.","3423":"Save a little money buying in larger quantities, as opposed to the smaller bottles. I like the taste of Agave, cross between honey\/maple. Good for pies, cereal, frozen yogurt, etc.","3424":"This is an awesome product which I've ordered many times.  Honey-like flavored, lower glycemic sweetener that's great in coffee or tea.","3425":"thank you for this product - we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent.  Thanks again.","3426":"I was out to dinner with friends & family at \"The Saloon\" in \"Rte 46 Entertainment Complex\" in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had.","3427":"If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff.","3428":"These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy.","3429":"These potato chips are DELICIOUS!  I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips.  Amazon lowered the price on these, and I finally had a chance to order them.  I most definitely will be ordering them again!  My family and I love them.  They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++","3430":"These chips are a great snack if you don't want all the junk assiciated with chips.  Try them you'll like them.","3431":"I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time.  The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor!","3432":"thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips.","3433":"Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet! Very hard to find in New Jersey. Can not have just one bag around!!","3434":"I can't believe how wonderful this chip is! The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. My family and I are offically addicted.","3435":"These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plocky's chips.  The only downside: the spice is minimal.","3436":"I think Plocky's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy.","3437":"These are the best chips I have ever eaten. Everyone in our family loves them. Sweet but spicy- crispy....really good. Delivery was perfect, no crushed chips. Fantastic overall.","3438":"A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :)","3439":"At first you think that these chips aren't all that Spicy, but the spice will grow on you with each bite.  They are really very good!","3440":"My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat!","3441":"We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didn't come near to them going stale.","3442":"I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture. Used to get them at Henry's in San Diego, CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since. Running out of them constantly!","3443":"These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!","3444":"We love these. Can't always get them in local stores, they don't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. Strong enough to dip in any condiment, great flavor and grain texture.","3445":"These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day.","3446":"The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.","3447":"These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.","3448":"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again.","3449":"Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips are really tasty. I shared a few bags with my daughter in Iraq. She said Ummm they are Good. They are good for you too. No artificial stuff.","3450":"We like Plockys They like us. Plockys Plockys. Mean no fuss. Taste so good. And healthy too. Plockys Plockys. Grab a bag or two. Thank you Plockys!!","3451":"I Love these potato chip they r soooo good! =) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate, not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon. LOVe IT!","3452":"The best potato chips I've ever had at the best price I've ever paid. The service was respectable and the shipping free.","3453":"I love this product.  All of the different flavors are fantastic.  My family likes the 3 grain the best.  No more corn tortilla chips in this house!","3454":"Love these chips, and I don't even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus, good for you!","3455":"These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC. They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had. A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit-o-heat. OH YA BABY.","3456":"Nice amount of heat and smoke. Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew.","3457":"These chips are salty with a hint of sweet. They are crisp and crunchy. They are the best chips I've ever had!","3458":"I was first introduced to the Red Rice & Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.  When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area.  On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... you'll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh","3459":"Ok. If you don't want to get addicted, don't try Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips! My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. Now, we've just received our second case. It won't last long. Beware.","3460":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000GWLUGU\">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7 Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)<\/a>  I first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in KY.  They are not available where I live, so I ordered them from Amazon.  WOW!  My friends and family are all addicted to them.  The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite.  Once a bag is open, it is gone!","3461":"We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.    Shelly Kenyon","3462":"Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast.","3463":"I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida.  My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.","3464":"I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them. I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!","3465":"These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!","3466":"These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)","3467":"They did a very good job with shipping the order quickly....Nothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship","3468":"Wonderful candy, hard to find.  I got a huge bag and put it in freezer.  It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic. Just great!","3469":"I bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else!!","3470":"So surprised to find the Taiwan-shaped pineapple cakes, they are so cute! I've never found any pineapple cake like this at our local Asian supermarkets, so I ordered some from here. These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun. My friends and I think it is a good idea to  order them again for our Mid-Autumn Festival party.","3471":"I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.  I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time.","3472":"I purchased this 24 pack of Big Ass soda and only got 23. Immediately I was all like \"Oh man, this is gonna suck!\". Regardless of the quantity error though, it sure kicked some red.  Everyone in my town absolutely loves it. I highly recommend along with other soda, Voltages.  -Malcom","3473":"Well being the big red fan that I am, I bought some of this. First of all let me tell you the price is amazing, I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia. Everyone in village loved it, of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it.","3474":"This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor.  It's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isn't terribly bad for your diet.  It's delicious!","3475":"I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!","3476":"Well worth the money. I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount  is an excellent value. There are approx 2338 pops in the box. So far I've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers. That's pretty good considering. If you need 30lbs of dum-dums go for this product. Enjoy.","3477":"If this flavor lasted longer than it does, I'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth.","3478":"this gum is super sick.tatooes are killin.flavor is a spankin'.this brings back bomb diggity memories yo.peace out.","3479":"If you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this.  Plus its hand made in the good ole USA.","3480":"I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed.  It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands.  I've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra.  Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good!","3481":"This soy sauce is the best we have ever had.  Thanks to Amazon, we were able to find it again.  It makes a big difference when using this product.  Thanks again","3482":"This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted.  I will surely order it again.  Such deep flavor.","3483":"Saw this on How it is made, which was a very interesting process. Decided to give it a try, I really enjoy the flavor it adds. Looking forward to trying it on several more dishes. Thanks to those who brewed it!","3484":"most soy sauce is from Japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields. I am not sure how long the contamination will last. I like the idea this product claims no GMO seeds. yea  You pay more but decided not to take a chance on Japan.","3485":"This is a bold blend that has a great taste. The flavor comes bursting through. I usually brew & drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJ's. I use this blend exclusively, so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic. Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service.","3486":"We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere.","3487":"This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think it's my favorite.","3488":"I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular\/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger\/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and\/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.","3489":"Of all the coffee's available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by far my favorite.","3490":"I think these are my favorite cookies ever. Really light and creamy. Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two-hundred count! I don't think I need THAT many.","3491":"I ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two days. He said it tasted really good, now I want to order some for myself, haha.","3492":"Great candy and our family loved it.  It was smaller than I imagined it and I thought it was expensive for how small it was.  However, I am in Germany and can get it easier here.  The shipping to the USA makes it expenive.  Great product and fun for our USA family to receive.","3493":"I eat mustard with everything, this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried, in fact everyone I tell to try some, falls in love with it as well. Spicy, tasty, real quality. If you like spicy mustard, you will love this.","3494":"This product works wonders if you have stomach issues.  I would buy again once I need more. :0)","3495":"Our ferret loves this rabbit; it's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet. The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store, which doesn't often have this item in stock.","3496":"These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as \"to go\" packs of honey for our coffee and tea.","3497":"My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...","3498":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order, my speediest delivery to date. It probably helps my location is near. Everything looks just as described and pictured and I'm very happy to have done business with this seller. The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside. I'm excited to give this item as a gift.","3499":"These cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat! The kids did not really care much, but it might have been more fun if they could have eaten them.  They really had fun coloring them!","3500":"This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning.","3501":"I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo, and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me. It's a sweet tea, which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner.  I see that others didn't like it, but it's really a matter of personal taste...different courses for different horses!","3502":"This is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one. Very tasty and a fast delivery too","3503":"My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven.  They didn't believe they deserved receiving these, but I know they did deserve to receive these!","3504":"This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to. I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it.","3505":"the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you","3506":"Low calorie and satisfying. These soups are a nice fill in when you don't want too much but don't want to be hungry for a few hours.","3507":"Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal.  She was very happy and loved the basket.  She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included.  Shipped quick and arrived when expected.","3508":"Received very quickly and extremely well packaged.  Since this is a smaller sized basket, it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea, for self or just to have to hand.  Very nicely assembled with attention to detail.","3509":"These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called \"jello shots,\" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups.","3510":"I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party! It was a big hit. They are high quality and a good buy.","3511":"Great for serving Chocolate liquor. Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake.","3512":"Delicious chocolate cups, each in its own aluminum holder.  I could not find these in any local store, so was happy to find them on-line. Most people are unaware of them, so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup.  After sipping the liquor, you can eat the cup.  What could be nicer?  Excellent product.","3513":"The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for.  The chocolate is delicious and holds up well to the liquors","3514":"strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor SWEET-but, not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors! Though, SPEARMINT isn't bad either. My next pick would be blueberry","3515":"I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores!","3516":"BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET TODAY.  HAD NUMEROUS EAR PROBLEMS WITH OUR COCKER SPANIEL AND THEY HAVE CLEARED UP SINCE TAKING THIS FOOD.","3517":"My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her!","3518":"Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years, and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any \"people food\" being added (of course, we still treat her occasionally).  When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment, the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didn't need any cleaning for another 6 months, at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?","3519":"Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!","3520":"This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues...I have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. Great product!","3521":"I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.  I only buy this brand food for him now.  Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars.","3522":"fast and great service, my Cavashon Loves this low fat dog food. Thanks. Arrived in great condition, thank you thank you thank you","3523":"We are Chocolate Moose & Mickey Moose,  Our nice owner bought this great food for us.  We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickey's food when he isn't looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :)","3524":"My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and it's good for him -- he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Hard to find elsewhere.","3525":"My 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much, but as time went on I found more and more uses for it. I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I'm running out! This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I've found in the grocery store.","3526":"Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies).","3527":"Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers. The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest.","3528":"Nice flavor, not too bitter.  We really like this coffee.  We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family's tastes and this is the one.","3529":"This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.","3530":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001ELL9X6\">Numi Organic Tea Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 16 oz bag (Pack of 2)<\/a>I brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half-gallon with this tea. Excellent. The resealable bags work well, and unopened they protect my large stash, making it easier to manage my subscription.","3531":"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha.","3532":"It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds.","3533":"I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.","3534":"I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did. I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products.","3535":"Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  I'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Food's gourmet salt.","3536":"This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had.  I just wish it came in bigger pieces.  I finished the whole box in one sitting!  I will certainly buy them again.","3537":"being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized","3538":"This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it's gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline, so it's great for changing your pH level in your body!","3539":"I recently started using Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda.  I'm very pleased with it's performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum.  Thanks, Bob!","3540":"I'm happy with the quality of the product and the price. Like the other reviewer, I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness. However, I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price.  Edit: I'm on my 4th bag, quality continues to be high.","3541":"Product is fresh, good and I'm not getting complaints anymore.  That's worth the large quantity and shipping charges.  Hey, its oatmeal. My favorite!","3542":"Good quality oats. Package came on time. Oats worked well in recipes. I will admit, as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year.  Otherwise it's an excellent buy.","3543":"I looooove pocky, got once at lucky's and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.  Great product, and great price from this merchant!","3544":"Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated.","3545":"Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.  As far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  Definitely a good buy.","3546":"First of all, I love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldn't have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi goreng...it was delicious!!! I now love mi goreng.","3547":"Bought these for my daughter's Grad party as well as the Strawberry. She loves these things. They're a great product.","3548":"Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this.  It is addicting.  That includes our 3 year old.","3549":"Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they don't they are lying lol. The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces.","3550":"These where great couldnt stop eating them. Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time. Cant say enough about these, they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped also. Thank you so much.","3551":"I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity, search for Pocky commercials on youtube!","3552":"This was the first peanut free product I bought for my son.  I thought they were tasty.  The kids liked them too.  For some reason they think they are strawberry bars.  I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state.  It makes for clean car rides.  Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best.  Berry is always left for last.  Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item.","3553":"My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness.","3554":"i love them. not too sweet but just right. any allergy free food is great in my book. hope non of these ingredients contains Corn...thats a no no for me too. HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 1\/4 OF IT OFF. IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE. THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN. I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE","3555":"My son has severe allergies.  This is an item he loves and is a convenience for me.  I feel good giving them to him and they taste great!","3556":"Tasty, convenient bars for people with celiac disease. They seem to have gotten smaller over time, but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size (and the price).","3557":"If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you won't be sorry you chose this product. My favorite flavor is the apple and nut.","3558":"This brand of granola bars are really good.  The very berry are my favorite.  However, the bars are almost ridiculously small.  Yeah, we're gluten free, so our food is a lot more dense than other food, but honestly, can we not have normal sized, good tasting granola bars?  They really are tiny.  So, the taste is GREAT but the bar is small.","3559":"Great taste. Great ingredients. Great texture. Absolutely delicious! They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. Either that or they taste so good he wants more.","3560":"Recently diagnosed a gluten-intolerant, I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. These snack bars fit the bill. They have the mouth-feel of a traditional snack bar, and a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor.","3561":"My son Loves these \"fruit bars\" they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars.  My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones... Now my son favors them (chocolate) ones MORE than the berry ones...","3562":"If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly.","3563":"My brother bought me a pound of this coffee for Christmas.  He told me that \"weaver\" was the original roaster for Pete's coffee, he eventually split off and started his own roaster.  Well let me tell you the stuff is delicious!  I've never been married to a brand of coffee, usually would buy the Starbucks 2.5 lb bag at Costco, or whatever looked good at Trader Joes, but Weavers is in a class of it's own.  I'm subscribing to guarantee I can have this stuff delivered to me regularly.  TRY IT!!","3564":"This is the best coffee we've ever had. A light taste but very full bodied. I was very pleased with the packaging, having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact. I must say you wont be displeased with your purchase, this is a must buy!","3565":"This is the best coffee we've ever had.  I run The American Pavilion in Cannes and Weaver's was by far and  away our most popular coffee sponsor!  Hundreds of people come to The Pavilion every day looking for American coffee and they were not disappointed.  We did a booming business this year!  Buy it!  You'll be so happy you did!  Julie","3566":"Numi has a winner here with this tea! My husband, son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner. It is very pleasant and the reason they love it, it does not turn bitter after longer steeping, like other teas do!","3567":"Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over! I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one.","3568":"My little girl can't get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars.","3569":"Its my daughter's favorite first and foremost.  For me I love that i can get lentils, there aren't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices.","3570":"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far.","3571":"I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all.","3572":"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family.","3573":"Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat\/veg dinners we have found!","3574":"This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times).","3575":"My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.","3576":"I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price.","3577":"My son really enjoys Earth's Best lentil!  He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more.  The product shipped very quickly.","3578":"I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.","3579":"This is one of my son's favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  It's more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up.","3580":"For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. I'm not a fan myself, but I'm not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, I'm a happy mom.","3581":"The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.","3582":"I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her","3583":"This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b\/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time.","3584":"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack.","3585":"My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat.  If we are going somewhere I won't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.","3586":"My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.","3587":"My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn't like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it.","3588":"My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.","3589":"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin.","3590":"The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken\/sweet potato favorite which is very runny.","3591":"I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.","3592":"Pretty good product.  The taste isn't the best but it's definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.","3593":"I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy.","3594":"Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!","3595":"This fruit gift really was the perfect gift! Everything was fresh, well packed and tasty looking! And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too. And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were! So thank you! I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected!SO THANK YOU AGAIN! Dharana,San Francisco","3596":"I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time I'll give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :)","3597":"As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.","3598":"I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or \"bark\" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.","3599":"I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.","3600":"I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didn't realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift.","3601":"I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!","3602":"bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn't had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he'd shut up.","3603":"Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again . Thanks Kim:D","3604":"I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it's very hot, didn't have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again.","3605":"Best paste I have tried! So easy to use. Just saute you meat, add veggies, paste, and a tin of coconut milk. Quick and tasty! I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat. It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter.. but the yellow, green, and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out.","3606":"This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don't use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!","3607":"Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.","3608":"I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great, also.  Goes very well over mashed potatoes, meats, etc.  Try it!","3609":"Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon.","3610":"I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all times. Never have to drink old coffee.  Best way to make iced coffee.","3611":"I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.","3612":"We can't have any kind of coffee maker at work, so we're forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or Starbuck's across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!!","3613":"These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess.","3614":"Fast, easy and definitely delicious.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make.  Good purchase.  Will continue to order from here. Thanx...","3615":"I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I've read about.","3616":"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny.","3617":"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase.","3618":"This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars...","3619":"This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product, and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there! It doesn't compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too!","3620":"My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased with the natural ingredients and no calories.","3621":"This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce.","3622":"I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater\/owner was giving an interview, It sounded interesting. The D.J.'s were sampling the sauce and raving about it, So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery, It's so good ! I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks,barbecues and party's. Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon.","3623":"This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!","3624":"They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  It's hot, but not without flavor.  I don't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce.","3625":"I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up.","3626":"This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!","3627":"So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.  The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.","3628":"absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it!","3629":"BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL.... My husband Loves this Habenero sauce, its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it. I in fact love the medium sauce- the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it. We used it for everything and you can use it with any meal.  I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness. We love the medium & habenero. Kind of like a \"HIS & HERS package\". Thank you for your hard work guys! Keep up the hard work.","3630":"Man what can i say, this salsa is the bomb!! i have all the different kinds. i have it with almost every meal. the owner is a cool dude, He's dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox. i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since. dont sleep on this hot sauce!!","3631":"this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it","3632":"I never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good! This is the real babka! That my gram mother use to make","3633":"I am so convinced these are human animal crackers. They look and taste EXACTLY like human ones (yes, I tasted it) and they contain sugar, which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. So ill just give my dog very small amounts.","3634":"I have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. She loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. She is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. About 20 per box.","3635":"My chihuahua loves these lil snacks. When she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles!","3636":"I purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends.  Both Yorkies LOVED these treats.  We had to finally buy more since they liked them so much.","3637":"These are just like the animal crackers we eat.  The price is great and my little guy loves them!","3638":"I tried this and I found it too salty. Plus I ate this fish sauce with some fish but I realized it was kind of redundant.  I'm kidding, of course. This stuff is great!","3639":"I don't usually drink tea but I love this one. I thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that I had to get it. Perfect with a little bit of Honey.","3640":"Cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever. couple of tbls of cavenders and 1\/4 vinager and 1\/4 h2O, rest oil. good!","3641":"It's balanced, it's tasty, it's filling, it's good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal?  I still miss Kellogg's sister product, Just Right, which was a somewhat lighter blend (I loved it, they discontinued it), but Mueslix is a strong second-best.","3642":"Don't know why I can't find these in my supermarket but I can't.  You get pack of 5 when you order.  Was afraid 5 boxes would last too long.  Instead found I need to order another 5-pack.","3643":"I bought this product online because, although it is a Kellogg cereal, I cannot find a retail store which carries it, and incidentally I would like to know why. I called Kellogg and they could really give me no good answer, and suggested I try another product of theirs, which i found not as good as this. I appreciate that Amazon offers this, and I will continue to order it.  By the way,  it really keeps me \"regular\", better than any other cereal.  Try it, you'll like it.","3644":"This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to, but it's the little things that count.  P. Looney","3645":"You could find this in local supermarkets about 4 months ago but now it nowhere to be found. Every time Kellogg's makes a great cereal, they quit making it soon after. This is the case with Just Right, THAT WAS THE BEST STUFF ON THE PLANET!","3646":"This has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years.  The grocery stores stopped selling it, so I've started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes.  I use them up pretty fast.","3647":"I LOVE THIS CEREAL.  NOT ONLY DOES IT TASTE GOOD, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.  IT'S A PITY THAT I CAN'T FIND THIS CEREAL IN ANY OF THE LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.  OTHER BRANDS DO NOT MATCH UP.","3648":"Have been enjoying Mueslix since early '90s.  Some reason, I can not locate mueslix in local supermarkets in New York, so I order through Amazon.  Taste is perfect not so sweet.  I do not care too much about raisins but in this cereal I do enjoy greatly.  It is enjoyable way to supplement fibers with whole grain, a perfect breakfast that lasts until lunch time!  Tried all different kind & choices of many cereals out there but there is nothing like Mueslix;","3649":"Amazon's price may be higher than some grocery stores, but it isn't in my store so this is a good way to shop. I first tried this on a Princess cruise ship.  I found it is very good and filling.  It stays with me, which is very important. I am super please to find this!","3650":"I almost can't stop eating this cereal...I eat it for breakfast and then in the evening, when I think I want something to eat and am really not hungry, I snack on these.  After all, it's healthy, so long as I remembeer it's not healthy to eat a cup or more.  Enjoy!","3651":"Our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelf......just not the same!  Great that I could order and have my cereal within days!","3652":"Mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago.  HOWEVER, they have (improved????) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich!  I simply add about half of a grain cereal, such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price.  Stores keep discontinuing Mueslix to the point that it is hard to find!  Thank you Amazon!","3653":"This cereal is hard to find in local stores where I live. My wife and I love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness. Whenever I find it in some hotel breakfast buffets, I am a happy man. I cannot think of eating any other cereal.","3654":"Kellogg's Mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in European B&B's on our last trip. Not available locally, but Amazon provided with a fair price, rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my Prime Shipping. Excellent form of Muesli!","3655":"Eating healthy never tasted so good. Tough to find in my local stores but Amazon has it at a great price especially through subscribe and save.","3656":"The Kelloggs Muselix are delicious and the delivery was quick.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001E6KBSK\">Kellogg's Crispy Blend Mueslix Raisins, Dates & Almonds, 15.3-Ounce Unit (Pack of 5)<\/a>","3657":"This cereal is the best cereal on the market.  It has many flavors, including nuts, raisins, dates, and especially a light malt flavor.  I have enjoyed it most mornings for years.","3658":"I have been eating Kellogg's Mueslix for years. I love the mix of fruit, almonds, and whole grain. It used to be easy to find but when I couldn't find it in my local super markets, I was afraid it had been discontinued. When I found it on Amazon, I was pretty happy.","3659":"It was a sad moment when I was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores.  I'm not sure why it disappeared, but am so grateful I'm able to purchace this online.  Thanks!","3660":"its hard to find in the us my husband frm jamaica and he loves it he says it makes him fill full all day i get it every mo.","3661":"I have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby. Much more convenient to order them through Amazon (slightly more expensive, but I save the gas and the burden).","3662":"The Kellogg Mueslix Cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. The item was well packed. Contents were fresh. Encountered no problems and plan to use this resource again.","3663":"Local grocery stores don't carry this cereal so I order it. It is full of nuts, raisins, and other great stuff. I cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar. My favorite box cereal.","3664":"Just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker, wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor, what was surprising was the fact that I knew I had added to much seasoning but it didn't turn out over powering. I would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat, the jerky is great, but the ribs are outstanding, and for 27$ including shipping for 12lbs, awesome deal.","3665":"I try every Asian salad dressing I can find. This is my favorite one for salads because of it's delicate taste. My other favorite is \"Newman's Own, Low Fat Sesame Ginger\". The ginger in Newman's gives it a stronger flavor which is great as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes.","3666":"Wow, this is soooo good and has easily become my favorite dressing! I typically make my own dressings, however I do use this one as a treat!  It was given to me as a gift and I absolutely love it! It's a perfect balance of sweet and oily and bitter. Granted, it needs a good shaking since it's oil based! I absolutely love this and am sad I am running out! If you eat salads like me every day, then you will want this dressing! It's unique and I NEVER had somebody over who didn't love it! :)","3667":"This coffee company delivers on great coffee taste!!  I like my coffee with deep, robust taste and Jeremiah's always is!!  It makes me glad to purchase it!!  Thanks!!","3668":"This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.  However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated\/dp\/B00375LAO0\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1. Comes with Prime shipping too!","3669":"I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape.","3670":"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon.","3671":"This is my very favorite tea of all. I drink it year-round and never get tired of it like I do of others. It's good any time of the day. Not too strong, but still nicely flavorful, with a good balance of minty\/spicy\/herbal-y.","3672":"Christmas Eve tea (which does not actually contain tea) is not just for Christmas Eve. (Although if you are frazzled, it does releave the stress.) Christmas Eve is good any time. I do not know anyone who doesn't like it, and have often given it as gifts. It is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as Christmas Eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint. It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories.","3673":"Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX it's so hard to find - maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7-layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, it's not too too spicy but is very good!","3674":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001GCVLXG\">Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack, 1.4 Ounce Units (Pack of 24)<\/a> My family loves these! It's a great 'snack' to carry in the car or it's a wonderful surprise in a lunchbag. The flavor is so rich and pure...I forgot how wonderful these shortbread cookies were. And the price is nice, too...as well as Amazon.com. I love this place!","3675":"Walker's Highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie, so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. Keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking!","3676":"If you like Shortbread you will really like these. Walkers always makes the best Shortbread. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001GCVLXG\">Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack, 1.4 Ounce Units (Pack of 24)<\/a>","3677":"COULDN'T FIND THESE ANYWHERE BUT ON LINE - IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRULLY GREAT TASTING COOKIES.","3678":"We love these sugar cubes in the office.  They aren't your grandmother's sugar cube.  They have a rugged appearance (can sugar cubes be considered rugged).  And we combine them with the white sugar cubes from La Perruche.","3679":"Love this for espressos...the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor.","3680":"Due to my husband's and son's inability to eat gluten, cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes.  I am very concerned with the prolific use of GMOs in corn especially and my family's increased consumption of it.  I wanted to find an affordable GMO free cornstarch product to use in all my baking.  Rumford Natural Cornstarch is the one!  I've been using it for months now with great success & satisfaction.","3681":"If you love garlic, I recommend this flavored oil.  It is true to its name.  I was not expecting it to be so strong, so if I use it for cooking or dipping bread, I will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future.","3682":"These things are AWESOME. Perfect size, truly wafer thin, consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior. They are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint. I first tried them when I was living in Germany 16 years ago, and to this day no other mint comes close. And the copycat ones? Disgusting. Go for the original. You won't regret it. Each mint is in its own sleeve, so you can pass them out without ever touching one. Elegant and delicious. Love them!","3683":"Love these mints.  They melt in your mouth and taste better than any others I have tried.  Just wish they weren't so expensive.  You can't eat just one, a couple.  They are addictively delicious.","3684":"I got it for my girlfriend. Very good stuff. Now everybody in the house eats them. Very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint.","3685":"A friend's favorite candy is \"After Eight\", but they are not available anywhere in my area.  I couldn't find them on-line either.  Amazon.com came through.  These are imported from England and the most delicious peppermint.  These are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell.  If you just want a little taste of mint, this is for you.  Really special with a cup of hot coffee!","3686":"You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high-priced \"organic\" green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea.","3687":"This is the favorite green tea in our household.  Been using it for years.  Was happy to find it here on Amazon, otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it.  Can't even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more.  By the way \"Ban Cha\" in Japan simply means common or everyday tea.  Not ceremonial.","3688":"I love this tea!! It is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas. It is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter.It has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too.It's great without sweeteners.  It is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl,long and slender. A little tea goes a long way. Enjoy!","3689":"I have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when I was going to Syracuse every summer.  This year I stopped going there and didn't know where I was going to buy my tea until I spotted it on Amazon and purchased it.  I was so pleased  that I could get it, so I am now a happy camper once again.","3690":"This is the real deal. Genmai Cha. Loose green tea and roasted brown rice. Not in bags. Originally known as the \"Peoples Tea\" for those who couldn't afford better. Very popular because of its mild flavor. You can drink it all day long (like I do). You won't be disappointed.","3691":"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it. She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it.","3692":"This tea won an award in the USA and I know why....\"Mandarin Silk Loose Leaf Oolong Tea\"  is like the name suggests \"Silk\" silk on your tongue.  A tea that has a warm, relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful...Well done \"Art of Tea\"!","3693":"These are identical to \"Jay's hot chips\" (are they made by the same company?).  They have a slightly sweet taste, with a nice bit of heat. Definately not overwhelming heat, on a heat scale of 1-5, I would give these about a 2.  Regarding the texture, these are not kettle cooked chips, so they do not have much crunch, they are comparable to regular Lays chips.  For about $1 a bag, they are a great deal.","3694":"I am from Michigan but have a vacation home in Canada. I have always been a fan of the primarily Canadian product \"ketchup chips\". Uncle Rays is a brand I've seen around there frequently. Since this is such a hard to find product I expected to pay big bucks to buy it online. Imagine my surprise when I found these chips on Amazon for a little over a dollar a bag- CHEAPER than the retail I would pay in Canada. Unbelievably delicious! Ps. The dill pickle chips are really good too :)","3695":"Mine came with stickers to sell them for $1.59 but they cost more like $1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. I bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap. Similar to Lay's but cheaper. Unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. Great product. Great price.","3696":"I'm not a potato chip addict, but sometimes like them as a snack.  I chose these because I'd never tried them before.  They are delicious, zesty, slightly sweet and spicy.It's like a combination of sweet and tart at once. The oils in these chips are better for health. It is hard to put the bag down.  They are made in Detroit Michigan and contain no trans fats, that's good enough for me. Try them.","3697":"These are some of my favorite chips on the planet! They are light, crisp, & not too greasy. The flavor is very Dilly. Love that! Great chips. Just hard to find.","3698":"These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL  I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)","3699":"Not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past, definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it.  Interestingly enough they feel more 'gourmet' when eating these. The flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese.","3700":"I thought they were very good chips, delicious!  and as soon as i run out, i'll be ordering more very soon.","3701":"These are hard to find, but worth the trouble.  Very tasty and very reasonably priced.  Love the product, and received very quickly.","3702":"I love uncle ray's potatoe chips. They have alot of spice on each chip.  They taste spicy with a tang of sweet. When I order a box, I pass them out to friends who love them. My husband, my kids and I eat a whole bag at a time.  I limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. The salt content makes me blow up, but I still love them.","3703":"It's difficult to purchase \"no-salt\" potato chips at most retail stores, so I ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of Uncle Rays.  They are great.  Not oily and they taste great.  You get the potato flavor instead of just salt.  I'll be buying these from now on!","3704":"We can rarely find these potato chips where we live, so I decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings. We cannot be happier with the ordering from Amazon! The chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing. Excellent and will be ordering again!","3705":"Who doesn't like vegetables that are portable and at a great price?  Can't beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package!","3706":"Everything AmeriColor that I have purchased works great! I was looking for some lighter tone colors, everything I had was pretty bright. These sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen, it's great! Thank you!","3707":"I love the metallic and sheen colors.  In a photo, the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real.  The sheen really kicks the color up a notch.","3708":"ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next day they came four days after wedding but they are nice","3709":"Sent very prompty, tea is delicious, will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm.","3710":"I loved this tea! It is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener. A great buy! I would definitely recommend this product!","3711":"3 boxes, under $6 each for all cherry - great buy.  I couldn't find all cherry in the store and don't really care for the other flavors.","3712":"Almost 150 Charms Blow Pops for less the 10 cents each.  These are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane.","3713":"this salsa is definitely one for the books!! A perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time.. Grown men crying because it's soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar... perfect for my cream cheese dip too! A+ across the board.","3714":"This salsa was delicious. It was very spicy as I'm sure you've guessed, but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I don't think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it!","3715":"Nice combination of ingredients so that it is VERY hot, yet still has great flavor. It has a little added sugar, which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. For the hotter salsas, you really can't go wrong with this. This is one of my top four favorites, which include Mrs. Renfros hot salsa, Screaming Sphincter and Pain is Good #37.","3716":"I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. Half the bottle was devoted to given people my \"not so hot salsa \" reactions amazing . Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all","3717":"my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one","3718":"I used to buy this at Target but it's cheaper at Amazon.  My cat goes crazy when I get out the bag so I know she loves it. Cheap to boot, also!  I don't really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food. I figure it's all pretty decent so why not save a little money...","3719":"There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.  The kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it.  Shipped right to your door.  Can't go wrong with that!","3720":"I purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 Lives Daily Essentials a month for my daughter's cats. They love it. She says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. They know what's in there and can't wait for it to be opened. If the cats love it, we love it. Isn't that how it goes?","3721":"My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor.","3722":"I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered\/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it.","3723":"My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  It's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  It's one of the better brands out there.","3724":"One of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. Great product to buy.","3725":"i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1\/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween.","3726":"dum dum lolly pops are the best! they come i lots of kinds and tast really good!","3727":"This stuff is great if you're looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor. The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.  Going to buy again for sure.","3728":"Not paying attention, I thought this product was simply vanilla extract when I purchased it, tried it in my coffee, and got a shock. Yummy!  I had to go examine the bottle, and realized my yummy mistake.  I wonder what glycerin is, what it's made of...? is it a fat? At any rate, it is delicious!","3729":"I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick\/syrupy consistency.","3730":"Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... What's not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit.","3731":"Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot\/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat.","3732":"Bought this for my mom for her birthday, she was dying to open it so we could all try it. It was nice and fresh and everything tasted great! Wish I had bought one for myself!","3733":"These dates were absolutely delicious. I was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star. But as I looked at all the other date reviews, the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the Fall timeframe. I had these delivered mid-January and must say they were quite exquisite. Many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party.","3734":"Expensive, but worth it, and Ive tried every Iced tea out there. Lipton is pretty good too, but this is the best!! Tetleys sux, and many other Iced teas like Bigelow are terrible, but this is great! Like the coffee shop","3735":"I have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles! The last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate, but I'll be buying them more of this...","3736":"I have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles.  I am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online.  I have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your Original Barbecue Sauce.","3737":"If you like soft licorice, these cats aren't for you.  A perfect anise-y balance of salty and sweet, these little licorice kitties are perfect! You pop one (or several) in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journey. Hard exterior. Lasts forever if you suck on them. Everlasting licorice Katjes!!  Very fresh. Super fast shopping too. Thank you guys!","3738":"Very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor. I love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options. I will be ordering more of this one.","3739":"the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives.  Generally I like to make my own sauce from scratch, but this is my second choice if I am short on time.  Its taste good and not artificially sweet.  I love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste.","3740":"These are the best canned tomatoes I have tasted. They have a fresh flavor, similar to home-canned. This is my second time buying a set. They are a little more acidic\/bright, and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes. Comes with a basil leaf in each can. Note, the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones.","3741":"These arent diced, its just mush, But I like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason- but dont expect diced.","3742":"Well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears, she was very pleased when she opened the box. Than her co-worker really like these gummy bears to.","3743":"I have been eating these since about 5 years old and are my favorite chips in the world! just dont eat too many of them!","3744":"I love these chips and couldn't contain my happiness when I recieved my box!! Love them, if you love spicy foods...get these!!","3745":"I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend's birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I don't think it's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid!","3746":"I used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. They came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. They do come in a group of 16...such a great value! I was extremely satisfied!","3747":"I bought these lollipops for my daughter's 3rd Birthday. They are super cute and the kids loved them. Definitely met my expectations.","3748":"I got these for my sons 3rd birthday. I got it because I am doing a candy station for his birthday & I wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station. So this is just perfect for my idea.","3749":"I used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them! They aren't full size, but they are still sooooo cute!!!","3750":"Bought these for a birthday and they were perfect--all arrived uncracked and wrapped really well. Super cute and perfect for 4 year olds.","3751":"comical that this is considered a 'toy'.  I bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition. I used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table.  Lots of compliments.  I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste...","3752":"Got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party, so I haven't actually tasted them. The lollipops are cute . . . the wrappers have writing on them, which I wish they didn't (would have been much cuter without the writing). They are a bit smaller than I expected (just slightly larger than a regular lollipop), and a few arrived broken, but really, they were well packaged, and looked cute for the party.","3753":"These arrived securely packaged, not even a chip on one lollipop.  They also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister's baby shower.  I would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers!","3754":"I'm going to guess that 'Yuck' didn't mix it up right, because, frankly, these taste surprisingly good considering they're supposed to be lo-carb. They're easy to make, and the non-diabetic in the house thinks they're just as tasty as I do. I do agree that the price is pretty outrageous, though.","3755":"I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best, try this one.","3756":"I made these recently for a holiday party.  I have never seen anything go so fast!  They were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients, mix, and throw them in the oven.  I will definitely be buying and making these again.","3757":"These are not as good at Houston's Samba Grill but they tasted great. The texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis, I have found something that I can make. I would surely recommend these to anyonr.","3758":"Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more!","3759":"My item got to my house on time and I was surprised on how well my package was packed. I recommend this store to anyone;)","3760":"Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight. The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself!","3761":"These are actually very tasty.  Pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler \"stuff.\"  No bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  They cook well in either the oven or microwave.  I add a touch of either salt & pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  I rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  However, this item is a fairly good value for the money.","3762":"They are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than Au Gratin, but nevertheless YUM YUM YUM!","3763":"I love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak...","3764":"I really like this product.  It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave.","3765":"Very good side dish, easy to make, easy to eat.  As others have said, needs a little spice, but other than that they are delicious!","3766":"excellent - will order again!!  It's nice to be able to order Omaha items from Amazon because Amazon ships SOOO fast, and payments are so convenient.","3767":"I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love 'em!!","3768":"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore.","3769":"We had these along with Omaha prime rib. Both were great. Two where plenty to fill up. Made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes.","3770":"These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these.","3771":"So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.  Yum!!!","3772":"I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck","3773":"They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal.","3774":"These potatoes are pretty good. They can be eaten alone or served with a meal. Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice.","3775":"I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree. Try them. You'll like them!","3776":"Very good transaction and Omaha food was sent properly.  I already left one feedback.","3777":"These potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers.  I would definately recommend Omaha Steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price!","3778":"I'm a big fan of Outburst Energy Bites, and the peanut ones are probably my favorite. They're reasonably priced and a great snack. Think of peanut M&M's and a coffee all at once. Since they taste so good, it is very tempting to eat the whole box. They claim it's a lot of caffeine, but it doesn't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation!  I highly recommend these!","3779":"ENERGY BITES F'ING RIP YOUR FACE OFF WITH MOLTEN LAVA ENERGY.  INFINITY ENERGY TO THE F'ING MAX.  I ATE A WHOLE BOX ONCE AND THREW A CAR AT A BABY.  F'ING RAVE.  SERIOUSLY THESE ARE GREAT.","3780":"It's a great product- especially if you like garlic! No need for \"slicing & dicing! (Which is a good thing when your right side is \"stroke paralized\"!) Just garlic too- not an \"oily & salty product\" Just plain or roasted GARLIC ! And it lasts a long time too!","3781":"I love my garlic spray so much, that i ordered more! I grow garlic, but I don't even bother juicing them anymore, not with this product. There are 150 cloves in every bottle. Thats a lot of yummy garlic...","3782":"I love the taste of real garlic - not the granulated or brined stuff. These are great flavoring agents, especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs. Love the choice between roasted and raw, and a little goes a long way. I first bought this product 2 years ago. Despite using one or the other at least once a week, I am only now needing to replace them. Yum!","3783":"I had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since I hadn't had any since I was in Arizona.  It was better than I remembered!  I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly, particularly if you like prickly pear teas.","3784":"Butternut Mountain Maple Syrup is the real deal. The grade B is wonderful on pancakes, or in coffee- just about on anything you'd like sweetened. Delivery was timely and the product came as expected. I recommend this!","3785":"I just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product. We love &quot;slickers&quot; which is what we call them, instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily. My daughter designed signs to be  printed in reverse to use on her car windows. They printed beautifully (we  have 'The Print Shop' program). I am going to have a lot of fun with this  product because there are windows everywhere and other surfaces like tv  screens and computer monitors.","3786":"This was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding. I use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made.  Two thumbs up!","3787":"After years of drinking Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster and some others, I have found the holy grail of energy drinks. It kicks in within 2-3 minutes and it lasts an entire work day. After seven hours or so, you gradually come down. There is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off. You just get very sleepy when you finally rest.  Redline Power Rush is the very best product on the market. If it were illegal I would buy it on the black market. 'Nuff said.","3788":"The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner).","3789":"Our family loves SPAM and Amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk.  The 7-ounce size is perfect for our use.  Amazing what you can use SPAM for.  Add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats!  Super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought!","3790":"It's a long time since Iv'e eaten Spam but I decided to give it a try. I always had left overs before but with this size can I simply enjoy every bit in one serving.","3791":"Well worth the price.  Very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing.  Can't wait for Amazon to get them again.  1 January 2012. Just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when I saw the price.  They were $12.00 when I purchased them in 2011.","3792":"Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy\/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.","3793":"THESE TREATS ARE THE ONLY ONES MY 14 YEAR OLD DOG WILL EAT. SHE LOVES THEM.","3794":"She will play with it before eating it.  Since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her.  They are expensive, but less so at Amazon than at a pet store.","3795":"I have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats!  I don't have to worry about them choking and I feel I am giving them a healthy treat!  Please don't ever stop making them Pet N Shape.","3796":"Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.","3797":"We found this on our recent trip to England and had to find it as soon as we got home. It's a standard for the Brits, and for us now too.  It's been around FOREVER. You can use it in so many ways; pies, trifle, donuts, cakes, by itself with fresh fruit and whipped cream, or even on french toast!","3798":"I am from England and I was raised on this custard. If you like vanilla custard\/pudding you will love this. It's rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste.  I love that it comes in a big canister and I can make as much as I want to. I would never make a trifle with anything else.","3799":"This is a great product, we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. We will purchase this product again. Amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage.","3800":"life without bird's custard has been hell ! i've tried other varieties-sthg from holland if i recall correctly-just not up to snuff...i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening.","3801":"I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.  I prefer it to other powdered custard(pudding) products for ease of making and taste. It's wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. Amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price.","3802":"Hard to find locally. Great price, especially with the free shipping.  Have enough to share with family and friends.","3803":"This is a wonderful and very handy product.  I'm thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used.  My aunt, who lived in Ireland for 7 years, said they used it all the time and loved it.","3804":"I love this tea. It has a mild flavor and no caffeine. The only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water. This doesn't happen once in a while, it happens nearly every time.  Triple Leaf Tea, please fix this bag issue. It's frustrating to the point where I may look for a similar tea from another company.","3805":"Anytime I have started to get even the slightest sore throat, I drink this and the next morning it's gone. I always bought it at World Market, but they said it has been discontinued. But, thank God for Amazon!","3806":"This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better.","3807":"A friend sent me two boxes of this for Christmas.  I thought it an odd gift, as I can just go out and buy herbal tea.  Shortly thereafter, I was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis. I started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked!  Not only that, during this time, other family members got physically ill, but I was able to carry on without catching the bug.  Since then, I'm a believer.  I make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed.","3808":"In cold weather, I brew this tea by the pot, keep it simmering, and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea, by the cup, made with this as the base.  My husband will drink it, and I can't get him to use any other medicinal.  (Hates licorise.)  It helped a great deal last winter.","3809":"Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well.","3810":"I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!","3811":"This is an excellent training treat for every day.  It's not a \"high value\" treat (used for more challenging training situations) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive.  It's a good size, though it does make some crumbs.  Plus, \"liver biscotti\" is fun to say!","3812":"Five of my five dogs agree - they'd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else.  I pull out a treat and they come running.  It cheers 'em up, encourages them to obey, lets 'em know I love 'em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!  And in a few instances when I've been slow producing the goodie, they've cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves!  I think it's a hit!","3813":"Our dog loves these treats.  We sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food, and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can.  We also use them as rewards for good behavior.  Wonderful, nutritious, really good to have on hand at all times.","3814":"Lucy loves these treats as does her friend, Daisy - I do not know what else to say to fill up the 210 word minimum.","3815":"My dog will do anything for these treats. Buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever.","3816":"Despite what many say and think about bulldogs, ours are picky about their snacks.  They love the liver biscotti which can be a hand-fed treat or used in a treat ball.  They last longer than most snacks and because our bullies don't often chew their food, these are the perfect size.  I don't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers.","3817":"Our dog named \"Big Red\" loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip. I am not too keen on driving that far so I found your mail service on the internet. Now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again!","3818":"They're perfect training treats for my dogs.  They go to the place where they're stored and stand there until I get a handful for our play games.","3819":"even my vet approves. these little treats are my dogs favorite. i just get the small ones because i have a small dog.","3820":"My dogs go crazy over Liver Biscottis. They are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome.","3821":"My dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for Liver Biscotti. Even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff.","3822":"If there is one thing our dog likes, it is the liver biscotti dog treats.  These make the best rewards and training treats we have used.","3823":"As another reviewer mentioned, these treats are CRUNCHY!. I like them for 2 reasons..my dog can't just \"woof them down\", she has to chew them, so they last..and I like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth. The treats are small, but again, are crunchy...I'm glad I found these. She loves them and I like giving them to her.","3824":"I have two dogs that absolutely love these treats!  The 5lb bag size that I purchased is very convenient and long lasting.  The vendor that I purchased them from is very thorough; several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and it's upcoming delivery. The price was extremely reasonable.  The best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day.  A guilt free doggie reward!","3825":"Our Portuguese Water Dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats. He loves them and will do anything for them.  Good Dog!","3826":"I DON'T MIND PAYING A LOT FOR A QUALITY TREAT FOR MY DOGS AS THESE ARE, BUT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN COMPANIES WHO PRICE GOUGE ON SHIPPING CHARGES.  ITS OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY (WHICH IS HIGH) FOR THE TREATS THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TO ALSO MAKE MONEY OFF ME FOR SHIPPING CHARGES.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT COST THEM $10 TO SHIP A 5LB BAG OF TREATS TO ME.  $6 DOLLARS WOULD BE FAIR AND ACCURATE, THIS IS THE REASON I GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5","3827":"Our four dogs love this stuff! This bite size treat is a perfect size for training. The dogs like the crunch - it's shaped like a small square crouton. There is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs.","3828":"A fantastic product for pet treats,great smell and has freeze-dried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds. Owner of 2 fussy cockers.","3829":"OMG these things are delicious!@ I'm not a candy\/sweets eater usually.. but ... OhMan! I liked them so much I may have had , two.. oops, now three!","3830":"I was just messing around on amazon when I ran into this add for beer nuts, when I noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny, being the beer lover that I am, I had to try them,  well they're here now and I cant drink beer without them, they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50's, and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america!  iIcan see why, they're pretty darn good.","3831":"i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid.  sorta like honey roasted peanuts, but more unique flavor.  if you never tried'em, if you like honey roasted peanuts, you'll love these!","3832":"great product! wish they were still available in bars,pubs,and stores.have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me. i'm just glad they are still available on line.","3833":"Some reviewers must have a short memory. I've been eating Beer Nuts since childhood and the ones I ordered tasted like they always have (sweet and salty). Bought them locally until I couldn't find them anymore. Great product and price for 6\/12oz cans.","3834":"After a second purchase of a 12-oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6-pack, I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them, this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle-ager. Nonetheless, everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand-alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers, Beer Nuts is a tasty, if understated winner.","3835":"this is the second time ordering beer nuts....i can not find them anywhere in local stores.  the shipment came (6 cans per order) and 2 cans were damaged.  called amazon customer service and the next day another 6 cans appeared at my door.  the nuts are always great (unless can is damaged and nuts are stale) but the customer service was the shining star.  thank you !!  will order again","3836":"My husband is a Beer Nut lover. Looked in many stores and could only find small bags. Love these large cans.","3837":"I am 76 years old and I have eaten these nuts for many years.  The ones mailed to me are very tastey.  The only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can.  No big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts.  I will order from Amazon again.","3838":"Not always available at our local stores. I love them. They are especially good watching football games, with you favorite malt beverage. This is a good deal, and super fast delivery, too. The nuts were fresh and tasty, as always.","3839":"These are the long time classic.  Not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts, these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew.  Amazon's price on these is really great.","3840":"This is the good stuff! I am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce. This pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely. It's colorful and tasty and is great \"al dente\".","3841":"All of the Castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful.  They have a great taste, hold their unique shapes, grab lots of sauce in your dishes, and have a nice \"bite.\"  This is a great price for this item!","3842":"Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it!  I have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one.  Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.  You won't believe the oohs and aahhhs you get at the table...worth every penny!","3843":"It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment.","3844":"It's always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them.  It's great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they don't arrive all melted.  Good Service and Excellent chocolates!","3845":"We love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at Amazon - it is WONDERFUL!","3846":"Best dipping chocolate ever! I dipped strawberries, pretzels marshmallows its wonderful. My whole family loves them. Great to bring out to friends or occasions! Dont forget the wax paper, otherwise it will stick to your plate!","3847":"I have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones.  The richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder.  It is just a better product","3848":"I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less \"tasty\" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product.","3849":"This cocoa powder has a deep, fruity taste- I highly recommend it.  I recently bought a vitamix blender, which means that I now make 5 smoothies a day.  This cocoa powder, plus some almond milk, frozen fruit, yogurt, and a dash of maple syrup, makes an excellent \"milk shake\".  Disclaimer: I like 99.9% of all chocolate, so take this positive review with a grain of salt.","3850":"Almost identical to Ghiradeli's great chocolate taste...but raw!organic! The best!!! I also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with Strvia and make ball\/snacks from it, yummmm","3851":"This powder, and this company, are both superb. There was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that I will be a customer forever.","3852":"This is a very tasty cacao powder.  It arrived in an unmarked bag (does not have an organic symbol or product description) but it seems to be the real deal.  Good flavor, similar to or better than name brand powders I have purchased in the past.  Will definitely purchase again.","3853":"bought as gift for hard to buy for father...he LOVED  bread said it was delicious !!","3854":"WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  ALL THE BREAD MIXES I HAVE TRIED ON AMAZON ARE NOT DISAPPOINTING!!!  WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.  THEY WILL MAKE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.","3855":"I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in \"store bacon\" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly\/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the \"good old days.\"  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.","3856":"Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great.","3857":"These are thin,crisp, fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty. They are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea. (my choices) If you like ginger snaps you will love Lars ginger snaps.","3858":"These ginger cookies are it...I don't have to look anymore ...I have found THE cookie ...I ate the entire box and did not share...so hubby said when I order more I have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some..:)","3859":"Very good.  Very tasty and authentic flavor!  I ordered these last minute for Christmas, not knowing if they were going to arrive on time.  They arrived at my house on Christmas Eve.","3860":"Didn't have time to make these this year so I thought I would buy them. I never buy cookies, but these I would buy again. My son loved them. The only thing I had to do was dip them in white chocolate. Thanks","3861":"After finding out two of our family members have celiac disease, we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs.  Candy Tree's Organic Cherry Bites have no sugar and truly rival the cherry nibs with gluten.  After a year of not having the \"real thing\" my husband believes Candy Tree's are actually better.","3862":"This licorice has very good taste.  My daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites.","3863":"Wow--this was the first licorice I'd had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice--not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product \"licorice,\" but they are merely rip-offs of \"Dots\" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice--very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for \"real\" licorice.","3864":"Gluten Free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to \"regular\" foods. This licorice follows that trend. For the times when you'd like to treat yourself, Candy Tree Organic Licorice is a tasty and safe treat for Gluten Intolerant people. Amazon seems to have the best prices on it too.","3865":"This dressing became an instant favorite of mine.  It's fat free without losing the flavor.  Alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions, and that only makes you have to use twice as much.  Wish Bone is now my only choice for Ranch dressing.  My husband doesn't usually go for fat free or diet anything, but I put this on our salads and he didnt even know!","3866":"If I had not purchased this salad dressing myself, I never would have guessed it was fat free. Served it with fresh vegetables during Thanksgiving pre-dinner, and it was a definite hit with the guests too.","3867":"Like the flavor and it's thick, unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny.","3868":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000ODRY9I\">Wish Bone Fat Free Ranch Salad Dressing, 16-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)<\/a>  This is a great salad dressing...tastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular 'fatfull' dressing.","3869":"The price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost $4. Don't know why the price on this has gone up though.","3870":"My doc has strictly limited me on what I can and cannot eat. I can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price. Good taste.","3871":"WANT TO TASTE SOMETHING DIFFERENT?  THEN YOU ARE COMING TO THE RIGHT PLACE.  I JUST LOVE THE SMOOTHNESS  AND FLAVOR OF THE RANCH DRESSINGNOW GET ON YOUR HORSES (OR MULES) AND ORDER SOME TODAY.","3872":"This is a very smooth tea from Argo Tea.  I was so excited when they came to NYC, and I bought a bag of this tea to make at home.  It has an almondy\/chocolatey flavor (but not overpowering).  It's a great tea for everyone, including people just starting to drink tea.  I love it in a Latte (I just microwave some milk and use that instead of water).","3873":"If you like jasmine tea, This is a great tea! Its lite not, overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. Its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl... I steep it so many times that until I lost count.. haha. Just Great .","3874":"We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...","3875":"Of all the flavors of tic tacs, these are my favorite.  Great wild cherry flavor. Love them!! Too bad they aren't more readily available to purchase locally.","3876":"These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy.","3877":"Definitely would reorder these again.  I think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack.  My kids love these.  Great little Valentine's Day gifts.  Great stocking stuffers.","3878":"I bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they're hard to find. I kept half for myself. I admit, gone in no time.","3879":"Everyone knows what a Tic Tac is, but let me tell you something; if you like orange tic tac's, you're going to LOVE wild cherry tic tacs!  Very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour.  Do yourself a favor and try some.","3880":"I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase!","3881":"I low orange tictacs and after reading reviews I decided to try these and there almost just as good. Orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close","3882":"These are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs.  The flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense.  You really get a lot of flavor out of one 2-calorie treat, which can satisfy for quite a while!","3883":"great thanks for the great service i don't know what else to say i have said all i have tu say.","3884":"Since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago, he took up the tic-tac habit with cinnamon tic-tacs.  they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are OK.","3885":"Very nice product full of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets","3886":"Were just what my wife wanted and she loves them. Next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor.","3887":"I love sorghum flour.  It's mild in flavor and smell, it's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  It's one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond.","3888":"I buy most of my flours from Bob's Red Mill in the 4-pack boxes, if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them.  It's good flour, and the bag's a good size for baking for a small family - also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it.","3889":"My sister is alergic to wheat so I make her a lot of Gluten Free foods.  I searched local stores and could not find Sorghum Flour.  So I looked on Amazon and finally found it.  It was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and I'm already using it.","3890":"I love baking with The Bob's Red Mill 'Sweet' White Sorghum Flour. I use it in many things but I tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as Cakes and Muffins. I make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for! I would highly recommend this flour to any baker, even more for the gluten-intolerant ones. I use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour. It always turns out fantastic!","3891":"I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.","3892":"Spectrum Naturals Walnut Oil, refined, is a very mild oil. I can't detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all. Maybe that's what you want in some cases, though I was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts.  It does have the advantage of having higher Omega 3 content than most oils. Also most oils that are high in Omega 3 (like fish oil and flax oil) have a strong taste which you probably don't want on your salad.  Unlike some of Spectrum's oils, it is not organic.","3893":"Great product!  The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.  Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.  Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.","3894":"This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it.","3895":"This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea.","3896":"I hated Stevia and it's licorice taste until I tried Nustevia.  Since that day, I have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks.  I like that it is a plant based product and not bio-engineered.  No after-taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet.","3897":"If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product.","3898":"I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended.","3899":"If you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go! I love Stevia in my iced tea and it's great on your cereal also. Great stuff!!","3900":"I started using NuStevia several years ago.  Back then I had to purchase it from a health food store.  Thanks to Amazon I can now order and have it within a few days.  I never run out!  As for the product, it's the best.  I've tried several Stevia products but they have an after taste.  Not with NuStevia.  Please try if you haven't.","3901":"I was looking for a healthier alternative to Splenda and Equal, NuStevia taste great and this container lasts a long time.","3902":"We love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything (beverages, desserts, cooking). It is not at all bitter, even in hot drinks like coffee. For baking, there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar ([...]). If you need to replace the \"bulk\" of sugar in a recipe, you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work ([...]). My kids don't notice the switch and I feel good about using it because it's all natural.","3903":"I am so happy I discovered this product. I had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and NuNaturals is by far the best. Virtually NO aftertaste, quick dissolving and convenient. It is also very economical at 1.5 cents a serving. I use a 1\/4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly. Do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder - you'll be happy you did!","3904":"I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the \"sweet\" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!!","3905":"I love this stevia! I have tried MANY different kinds over the years and this one is my FAVE! Goes great in my coffee and tea. I have this one on auto ship and get one a month (makes it pretty cheap too!)","3906":"I have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is, hands down, the very best out there.  I use Nu-Naturals NuStevia for all sweetening purposes.  It can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium.  I was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order.","3907":"this stevia is the best tasting we've ever tried. it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others.the service from this buyer was prompt, the product arrived on time and in excellent condition. would order from them again, and recommend them to others.Linda blyth","3908":"I ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. It is not bitter at all and has a very fresh\/clean taste to it.  I have baked with it, used it on the stove, and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  When I run out, I'll be ordering more!","3909":"I find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands; vs using\/opening sweetener packets.  This product works well both in cold & hot things like homemade lemonade & in coffee.  Easy to open lid. Product dissolves more easily in cold liquids, than many other types of stevia.","3910":"Very happy with the product.... in a taste test, for the price, it ranks very high.  Delivery was prompt and as expected.","3911":"Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank.","3912":"Roland Red lumpfish Caviar is excellent.The price is good and affordable,it makes a good presentation for company, and tastes very good. I purchased many items from Amazon, even large ticket items, and I am very satisfied with the products and service.","3913":"Because they brought bagels to America without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar.  Caviar for breakfast!  We use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee.  This is is best done on a week end so it can be savored ever so slowly--no stress involved--pure luxury.  Yes, Yes, Yes, yes, yes.","3914":"Not knowing what to expect I decided to take a chance since it wasn't that expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar.  I put this stuff on just about anything I could and it was amazing.  I don't know too much about caviar, but for this price I don't think anybody can complain.","3915":"This is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes  with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top. Soooooo tasty and pretty for Christmas. Thanks for offering it.","3916":"All of the Roland products are top quality.  Roland's caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed!","3917":"if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family.I give this 10 stars.","3918":"Cooked in healthy coconut oil that's why it stays crunchy! Will not give you side effects of vegetable oil - oxidized cholesterol, transfats, rancidity, and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil.","3919":"These are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat. Superior flavor and size than the Fla-Vor-Ice case.","3920":"This  coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever tasted,and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner.","3921":"I love this coffee! Like the other reviewers, I took a trip to Costa Rica and was immediately addicted to this bold, flavorful coffee. I am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that Britt is hands-down the best I've ever had. I brought back one bag from Costa Rica and have started ordering my supply because I can't go back to other bland store-bought coffees. Definitely worth a try! You won't be disappointed.","3922":"This coffee is delicious. It is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste. My dad told me about it after a trip to Costa Rica.","3923":"My husband and I took a vacation to Costa Rica and had a wonderful time.  The whole time we were there we drank there Britt Dark Roast and loved the taste.  There was no bitter after taste, plus I normally drink decaf and noticed with the Britt regular dark roast it didn't bother me at all!!! I don't have to order decaf anymore and can enjoy the regular. I now order it on line and find it to be the best tasting coffee I've ever had. Thanks for growing the best coffee beans in the world!!!","3924":"Great tasting coffiee!! One of the best I've ever had! The problem here is the high shipping costs.","3925":"My husband and I fell in love with Cafe Britt coffee while we were in Costa Rica.  Upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon.com!  The coffee is easy to drink - not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day.  Highly recommended.","3926":"I used to use this coffee after we visited Costa Rica and gave some to my aunt.  She thinks it is the best coffee there is, so I gave her some for Christmas.  It is excellent.","3927":"I first tried Britt dark roast when I was In Costa Rica.  It has a lot of rich flavor, but it is not bitter at all.  I've bought it by the case ever since.  It's really no more expensive than those \"gourmet\" brands you find at your local store.  This is simply the best coffee I've ever had, and I've tried many supposedly special ones over the years.","3928":"I used Super Gold Luster Dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the groom's cake at my son's wedding. By using an artist's paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with Luster Dust, the result was startlingly beautiful. In contrast to food coloring, the Luster Dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen. The containers are small but the product goes a long way, making it extremely economical to use. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1933981350\">The Step Dynamic: A Powerful Strategy for Successfully Growing Your Business<\/a>","3929":"I have used this product multiple times.  In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out!  I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets - including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it!  The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful.  I can't recommend this stuff enough!","3930":"i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust, never thought i would find it, but im glad i did. when i sprinkled it on it looked  like a shining star. the container is small but it will go a long way. worth buying.","3931":"This product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings.  The fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but \"show off\"  People are amazed that this is edible gold","3932":"These radiation-treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down.","3933":"I subscribe to several Hormel Compleats. This is definitely the best flavored dinner I have tried.  I am planning to double my subscription.","3934":"Not so sure about this product. Chicken and Rice is not really what there is. Sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy. All in all I still like it.","3935":"These dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains.  Quick, easy and delicious!","3936":"I'm not so sure why the other guy didn't like this so much, I LOVE IT!!  In fact, it might just be one of my favorite foods around.  It's tried and true, rarely cooks wrong, and always good to warm the belly and soul.  I only but this flavor, it's so good, why deviate from it?  I have tried other brands before, bit Maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time.","3937":"A bit dry but still good. They may be perfectly all right; I just thought the noodles were hard and dry. I'm still enjoying them.","3938":"I ordered this 13-pack sampler, and I have to say that I really do like the flavor of the Donut Shop Classics pods.  They are mellow, smooth, and have virtually no bitterness.  I just can't believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods.  I give them four stars because I prefer freshly roasted and ground, but to date, when I'm in a hurry in the mornings, which is most mornings, I reach for a pod of Donut Shop Classics.","3939":"With this spice mix, you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews.  It is potent, so do not use too much. It smells heavenly. Perfect for both meat and bean stews.","3940":"If you like garlic this is for you. I've been making this as a dip with Greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise. I usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips. I have gotten rave reviews from my friends. My only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out.","3941":"<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:38 Mins  <\/span>skip the Pad Thai. go for this. edit: this soup has moved up to the #6 spot when I typed in Dr. McDougall today. I'm glad, because I want to order this for a while, and don't want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by Right Foods (Dr. McDougall).","3942":"This is a very tasty item. My wife doesn't eat meat and had to stay in a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended. I had this shipped to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more!","3943":"Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product.","3944":"These are super tastey! I would definitely recommend. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish they were bigger! :D","3945":"Super tasty quick meal.  It's a bit small, but perfect for a lunch on the go.  Definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs though.  The sodium is a little higher than I'd like, but I really can't beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood.","3946":"These papers are great, they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips. Even the glue tastes good.","3947":"These smell so good and are cute and a great size, with a bend in the middle to help roll, and holds together really well with tasty glue. Definitely recommend. Smell like strawberry bubble gum, doesn't really affect flavor too much, but better than plain ones and very sweet. Box says \"printed with soy ink\" so it's clean and I don't have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics.","3948":"These rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper","3949":"Excellent. Very nice, rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle. mmmm.....  Delish!!!","3950":"If you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use. The real San Marzano, beware of imitators!","3951":"I wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so I ordered this and Caputo \"00\" flour.  These tomatoes are amazing,  and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite Italian pizza restaurant.  The label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil.  This stuff is jsut awesome.  I ordered another 8 cans.  Shipping kills though.","3952":"This product arrived with the sanitary seal in place and in good condition.  After nearly 10 months in Iraq, being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste.  I really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great.  You may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that, though =)","3953":"Not wanting to pay $9 per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans, I came to my favorite online store, Amazon. With free shipping I could not beat the price. I went from paying $9 per pound to $3.50 per pound. I was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious. I bought them for my mother for Mother's Day because she did not get a chance to buy any for Easter. With 10 pounds, I had plenty to share with my friends too.","3954":"These jelly beans are wonderful.  They are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn't take away the flavor.  I would recommand these to anyone.","3955":"Soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added. It's a great, nutritious, high-calcium, no cholesterol product at a great price. Buy a case.","3956":"This product is very good.  It goes a long way.  But quite as good as the one at DD.  Good product not the less.","3957":"I absolutely LOVE the just tomatoes tomatoe slices. I thought the bits might be good for soups etc., but they don't seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices. I will ues these up, but go back to the slices. On the whole, a great product.","3958":"I toss some of these in soups, or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings. They add a nice somewhat meaty flavor, (almost like bacon bits but healthy), to almost any dish.","3959":"You can find this 6-pack for $40 dollars less at diapers.com.  No reason they should be charging this much.","3960":"I eat this pasta every day, without guilt. I love this pasta. I maintain my desired weight without any problem. You have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta, but it is every bit as good.","3961":"I love this stuff and only get it through Amazon.  It arrived on time and good condition and I enjoy it.","3962":"Just a quick note... a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product.  We bought a box at Whole Foods and I was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content.  Amazingly it's about 40% cheaper at Amazon than at Whole Foods, and being an Amazon Prime customer saved me on shipping. I'll be back for more soon.  I love quality and a bargain.","3963":"Love this pasta.  I mix this with regular pasta for a meal, half and half.  Love the lower calories and the fiber content.","3964":"My husband and I have been on a low carb diet for two years and I miss pasta most of all. We've tried other low carb pastas and weren't crazy about them, but we loved Fiber Gourmet. The taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta. Unlike other low carb pastas, we didn't experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues (if you know what I mean). I can't wait to try other products from Fiber Gourmet.","3965":"Love this pasta.  Does cook up a little firm, cooked it a bit longer. Had it with pesto very good.  My husband could not tell the difference so I know it is good.  He is very fussy.","3966":"I am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds.  I was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until I came across this product on Amazon.  I cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat Greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy.  Definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save.  My hubby and son love it too!","3967":"I don't know how they do it but this product is too good to be true.  Half the calories of regular pasta!! Wow.","3968":"Great product.  Recommended by Dr. Oz.  We love pasta but not the calories.  This is much better than whole wheat.","3969":"I brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family. We all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne  very much.","3970":"First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target\/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods.","3971":"I am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering.  The strength of the coffee itself is very good.  I can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the Senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money.  Plus, it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning!","3972":"So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.","3973":"This by far the best pudding mix, you don't see this on the store shelves.. Everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding.. and I guess most don't like to cook pudding on the stove, it is best when pudding is cooked cooked.. Instant pudding does not equal this..  Carl","3974":"We've been searching everywhere locally for this putting.  I was so elated to find it on Amazon.  This is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!","3975":"My honey has a serious sweet tooth, which I accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. Martha White's Muffin Mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one-half cup of milk, which I toss into my cuisinart; and wah-la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. They are moist, delicious, and economic.","3976":"WE LOVE LOVE LOVE these muffins. They are moist and delicious !! We like them best the day you bake them. The 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up, then they are good as new. Our only complaint is that they are DIFFICULT to find !! BUT DEF Worth every penny !!","3977":"This was my first time purhcasing muffin mix as well as baking muffins.  To me the muffins came out a little dry, but tasted great and the people I shared them with said they were good too.  I will, more than likely, purchase Marth White Muffin Mix in the future.  The muffin mix came at an excellent price and I can't complain. Thank you Amazon.com for having most everything under the sun for sale.","3978":"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food.","3979":"Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge.","3980":"I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again.","3981":"This is quick, easy and portable, and I think it tastes great! It's my favorite flavor.","3982":"It's very tasty and very easy to make.  If you're in need of a very quick, filling meal and it needs to be gluten free, this works out great.  Try the Thai Peanut one, too.","3983":"We ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly! My husband and I both like taking them to work for lunch. Here's my recipe, so that I get more protein: I slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before I leave home in the morning, then I add the egg to the water before I cook it at lunchtime.","3984":"Very tasty gluten-free option.  My kids loved it as it wasn't too spicy.","3985":"The Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are quick and easy to prepare. You will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer.","3986":"I liked this so much that I re-ordered and will keep  re-ordering.","3987":"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just \"melt\" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan.  Then add your favorite meat and veggies.  I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies.","3988":"Much hotter than your normal green curry. One pack makes many servings.","3989":"Second order.  Very good, hot which I like but best to sample as per your preferences.","3990":"I was really impressed with this.  There are many flavors, and quite a bit of heat.  With this and your favorite brand of cocunut milk you can make some great Thai curries at home.","3991":"Different flavors for different people.  Not everyone is going to like this just as others, like me, will love this coffee.  It's totally subjective.  I give it 5 stars.  I enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable, in my opinion.  It matches my local big box grocery store.","3992":"I was at a 5 star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting.  It was fantastic.  I asked the server if they could get me the name of the company, but they were unable.  Thank goodness for Amazon I was able to find it.  It's the best I have had in many years.  It arrived on time and very securely packed.","3993":"I totally love this tea.  It brews to a beautiful reddish color.  It is very aromatic and beautiful to look at.  It could be potpourri.  I love the sachets it comes in - very elegant.  I just bought my third canister of it this morning.  I have everyone at my office and my friends loving it, too!  Best with honey pearls also sold by White Lion Tea.  And it's organic!","3994":"This stuff rocks!!! I've had it at two different spas and I just love it. It's tart and really unusual. A real treat.","3995":"This is my husband's new favorite tea! I'm not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good. I'm sure we'll be buying more.","3996":"Nice tea. I can steep up too 3 times. It has a strong cranberry flavor. Probably would be good as a cold tea. I recommend if you LOVE cranberry.","3997":"Love it, love it, love it!  Both me and my 10 year old drink this herbal tea quite often.  Very tasty!","3998":"This is very good tea in an elegant sachet. A little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you're drinking it hot or cold.","3999":"I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.  And this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level.  I catch my cat sneaking over to my dog's food bowl and eating this food, too.  I have to look into getting her some Harmony Farms!  I can do this because Harmony Farms is really good quality food that is affordable.","4000":"I just ordered this, came today and thought I would just try it, well to my amazement,My little Daisy ate it and wanted more.My little Dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with Flare-ups with her pancreas, I have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber. I have been making her dog food ,but she missed eating the dry,I wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was.","4001":"Had been feeding my 3 hounds Purina One (which they liked) and thought I'd try this since it's not much more and I liked the ingredients. They LOVE it and I plan to order more in the future!","4002":"Our ten year old doxie...Annie NEVER, that's right, NEVER would eat ANY dry food UNTIL....Harmony Farms Healthy & Holistic Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food that we bought from you! Every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food! Amazon...you are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this 17.5 pound bag of Harmony Farms Dog food from you...we'll be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag.  Wow! So happy about this...","4003":"Wish I would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes. My 6 year old Jack Russell has always had the worst shedding problem and I recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition (was feeding her P*urina dog chow). She's only been on this dog food for two weeks and I can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding! She loves the taste and I love the price for such a good quality dog food.","4004":"When I purchased the Harmony Farms Healthy Weight Formula, I had a Mini Dachshund and Jack Russel Terrier.  Both of them love it.  I have added a Shih Tzu to my pack and she loves it, also.  I would highly recommend it to others.  The kibble is just the right size for small dogs.","4005":"The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  The other nice thing is that Target sells this brand, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you haven't ordered more in time, you can stop by Target.","4006":"I am very pleased with this dog food. My sheltie has a good coat and good movements with Harmony Farms. Does much better with this food than others. He is a very picky eater, so I do add chicken and he will eat. We will stick with Harmony Farms. I also like the bag, it helps keep the food fresh.","4007":"My dog loves this food, and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years.  The vet is very happy with her general health, coat, and teeth.  Having the 16lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific!  The 16 lb. size is not available in my area.","4008":"While on a family camping trip with Josh our 8yr old Golden, we ran out of dog food. Stopped at a Wegman's market in Erie PA to shop for a quality food. Settled on the Harmony Farm's chicken. Josh liked it right away. We've been mixing it with his normal food (Canidae). He's very healthy and playful, his coat is shiny. He's a happy pup.","4009":"My dog loves, loves  this dog food.I had to say love twice, because this dog food is one of his dog's favorite.","4010":"I have purchased this product once before from Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and in tact.  This is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at PetSmart in New York but in Arizona, it is no where to be found.  This food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all.  We try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it.  So now we go through Amazon and our dog is quite happy.  Bought a double amount to receive free shipping.  It was a very good deal.","4011":"My dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through Amazon I am able to save money per pound and trips to the store. It arrives promptly and is the same quality as always. Harmony Farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods. LOVE IT!","4012":"I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy.","4013":"This dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues , as they have had with other brands.  They both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food. I have been very pleased with the automated delivery service.","4014":"Since I live in a rural area sometimes I'd drive to town just for dog food...needless to say that was expensive.  For $26 w\/free-shipping the Harmony Farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality \"name-brands\" - my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry & flaky. I love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy.  Very thankful it's something I can afford as well.  Only wish Amazon offered a 'subscription service' for this item like they do on others.","4015":"I am always pleased with the variety of shopping items, that I find on Amazon.com. I have never been disatified with my purchases through Amazon.com. When searchomg for things, even dog food, I automatically go to Amazon.com before any other site. Rarely do I chose another site.  Amazon.com really rocks.  Thanks for being there! J.Meadows, Syracuse, NY","4016":"I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:)","4017":"These chips are wonderful.  My kids and I all loved the salt and pepper. Each .8 oz bag was 100 calories, lots of chips for the calorie count.","4018":"Great packaging, and item is just as described. Will purchase this item again. They were shipped very fast, and efficient.","4019":"Got this item on a one-day-only sale on Amazon.  Love having the single-serving portion as I am following WW plan.  Only 3 points plus per serving.  Tasty and on the same line as the Special K crackers.  The variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile.  Cheddar and BBQ are my favorites.  Try them...","4020":"I really liked these chips as did my entire family. I wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. I would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind.","4021":"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks.","4022":"I had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local Target in 3oz. bags.  I am so glad that I bought this variety pack! Not only did I discover other flavors that I enjoy, but it's single serving size so it's better for portion control.  I love popchips, and I find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips!","4023":"I like these chips a lot! Now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i Fish!","4024":"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh.","4025":"For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie\/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase!","4026":"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!","4027":"I like all the varieties except the salt and pepper.  They taste too much like black pepper and nothing else.  The others are very goodl<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001RVFDOO\">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)<\/a>","4028":"The products are wonderful and fresh!!  Everything reported about the chips is on target, and I would recommend them to others.  Amazon's services are fantastic!!","4029":"I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.  I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??  Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.","4030":"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring.","4031":"I have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have I found a great choice in PopChips!  These are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips.  I love Special K cracker chips, but they only come in big bags.  I saw these and they are packaged the way I like (individual serving bags), so I gave them a try.  Now, I will never be without them!  They are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag.  Finally a good-tasting, healthier potato chip that I can enjoy!","4032":"I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again.","4033":"These chips are very tasty,  Its a nice size serving and only 100 calories.  Good grab and go snack for busy Moms","4034":"The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks.","4035":"Aboulutely love Popchips!I first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in California. I like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.","4036":"This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.","4037":"Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!","4038":"I have to watch my calories, but I tend to not be very successful if the food I eat is tasteless.  I have enjoyed all six flavors of these Popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag.  My favorites are Sour Cream & Onion and the Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors.  In fact, they're so good I just want to keep eating them; and have to resist opening a second bag, because that really defeats the purpose!  I like the variety pack and it's not a bad value.","4039":"The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.","4040":"I love these chips, they taste so good I am on a low cal diet and they are perfect. The individual bags keep you honest. Thank you PopChips","4041":"These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!","4042":"I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite!","4043":"These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size","4044":"A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.","4045":"These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.","4046":"These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.","4047":"I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips, they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor.  I am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend (who hates anything that's healthy).  I recommend these to all my friends.  I'm on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all.","4048":"I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind,  I use the plain chips to dip with my salsa.  I would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not.","4049":"This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.","4050":"Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly, but by the time the first bag as gone (I have a husband and kids), I was hooked. Wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it. Personally, I like the plain and also the salt\/pepper. My kids love all of them though and, while these aren't fruit\/veggies, I feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips.","4051":"We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids. Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with \"regular\" fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative.","4052":"I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online.","4053":"I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said, Pop Chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors.  My favorite flavors are Salt & Vinegar by far.  The calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair!","4054":"I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the \"Food Should Taste Good\" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well.","4055":"The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.  We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.","4056":"These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.","4057":"Found these while looking for good, cheap, low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office.  After my first shipment, I decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe & save.  My next shipment arrives in two days. I'm so excited!  Gotta have my pop chips...","4058":"My husband and I both really like the popchips.  They are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying.","4059":"I read a reference to these on Jillian Michaels's website, checked out the Popchips web page, and liked everything I read. But the proof is in the tasting, of course. They arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that Popchips are incredible. They taste SINFULLY good, crunchy and just yummy. I love sea salt and vinegar chips in general, and truly LOVED the popchips version. Anyone on Weight Watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!","4060":"What a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track.  These are very tasty and crunchy - great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves.","4061":"My whole family loves these \"chips\".  I am following the Weight Watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points, there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it!!!","4062":"i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks. my friend told  me about pop chips that she bought from amazon. she said she loved them and i should give them a try, i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good. and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack","4063":"The only complaint I have with pop chips is that I can't get all of the flavors at the stores where I live!!! My husband and I both LOVE pop chips, his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion.  Pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake!!!! We cannot say enough good things about them!","4064":"I LOVE PopChips.  They have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste.  They are very similar to munchos--very light and fluffy.  If you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving, these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories.","4065":"I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.  Not so...  They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.  I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means \"low salt.\"","4066":"Popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. They are clean, light, deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavors.They would make a great lunch box addition. Popchips will be on hand in our home from now on!","4067":"I received my box of assorted Popchips a few days ago to support my Weight Watcher meal plan.  I absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan.  Without hesitation I recommend all varieties of these chips.  What a great idea!!!","4068":"What a great snack!  I love these crispy, crunchy, treats.  Packaged in a single serve bag, I buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so I have them on hand whenever I feel the urge to snack. Unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than I had anticipated.  Time to order some more!  All the different flavors are seasoned just right--not too salty or spicy.  I love Popchips!","4069":"These chips are awesome. The light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack. I am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice. Gives me that salty, crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day. I love them. I have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them. I haven't tried all the flavors yet, only those in the variety pack but trust me I will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite. That may be difficult they are all so good!!!","4070":"I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through.","4071":"We absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from Amazon we were able to find them in Target.  They have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren't trying to loose weight.  Recommended by weight watchers.","4072":"Popchips are absolutely delicious, and getting the variety pack is great.  Everyone in my family has a favorite flavor.  Highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving, but are not nearly as bad for you as chips.","4073":"I really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat.  I especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar.  I don't care for the salt and pepper.  I wish I could get a multipack and choose the flavors I want.","4074":"We have played this with three adults.  fun game that does not take too long to play.  makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans.","4075":"That's all I can say. Yum at a great price! I can't find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome.","4076":"Great low cal snack... satisfies the crunchy, snacky, salty cravings without high calories.  All flavors are good;  The cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste.","4077":"I have a free sampling of these chips and I can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. They remind me of Munchos, but are less greasy. Try them.","4078":"If you haven't discovered Pop Chips yet - you don't know what you are missing.  Low calorie and high in flavor.  Great for the kids lunches. I need the single servings or I will eat the whole big bag.","4079":"These have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt, and or sugar.  They have texture and flavor, and a bag hits the spot.  I would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines.","4080":"I LOVE Popchips!!  These are the BEST.  Individual serving bags, flavors are great, taste is excellent.  My daughter and grandson love the barbeque.  I have found that buying them through Amazon is cheaper and Amazon offers the bigger bags also.  I have to watch that because I could eat the whole bag.","4081":"I am a chip fanatic, when I heard of these, I HAD to give them a try! They are very tasteful esp. the bbq one's.  I have yet to try the other flavors but I am sure they will not disappoint.  I watch my weight\/health so these are perfect, just becareful because they are addicting!","4082":"Good Variety of the flavors, makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer. Also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack.","4083":"This is a great snack to have instead of potato chips. Lower in calories but still delicious. Will be ordering them again.","4084":"I love Popchips. They are delicious and I can't believe one bag is only 100 calories. The flavors are great although I am not a fan of salt and pepper. I would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors. I am sure you will love them too.","4085":"I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!  These Popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. Though I don't really care for the pepper flavor, I like all of the others.  I will buy these again.","4086":"I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didn't know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case!","4087":"These taste great and are a healthier alternative. My favorite was the sea salt and vinegar. I probably won't order the other flavors again since I have a favorite, and don't eat potato chips all that often. But the variety pack was great to get to try them all.","4088":"These are great - my entire family loves them.  It is a great addition to my son's school lunch - and I have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal \"chip\" out on the market.  Great flavor - BBQ and Sourcream & Onion are our favorites!  Love the single serve bags - wish you could buy them at the store - but for now I will continue to purchase on Amazon...  because of the great service and varieties!","4089":"These chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried. I love love the bbq flavor.  I also like how the chips don't crumble in the bag.","4090":"These are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal.","4091":"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!","4092":"Popchips are very good.  The varity received lets you try the diferent flavors.  I only wish I could find them locally.","4093":"These are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake.  You get a lot of chips for minimal calories, and they taste great!!","4094":"Great selection of chips & very fresh. If you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips & don't like the fake taste of baked, these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. I bought 2 cases & every time I'm at Target or our Super Box Store I make sure to pick them up!!","4095":"I loved these chips. They were exactly what I had been looking for. They are not fried\/greasy or baked\/dry they were great-tasting, satisfying, and healthy alternative to regular potato chips. You can feel good about eating these chips. Can't say enough, you'll have to try them for yourself! I am ordering more now!","4096":"The chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and Weight Watcher point value.","4097":"Here is a nutritional breakdown:  Calories: 100 Calories from Fat: 30 Total Fat: 3g Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Poly and Mono: 0g Cholesterol: 0mg Sodium: 160mg - 7% Potassium 180mg - 5% Total Carbohydrates 15g - 5% Dietary Fiber 1g - 4% Sugars 2g - 4% Protein 1g Calcium 2% Iron 2%  For Weightwatcher folks this breaksdown to 2 Points.......","4098":"We tried these chips because DR. OZ had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative.  My whole family loves them, we have not found a flavor that we don't like.  These are WAY better than any baked style chip.  Try them and you won't be disappointed!","4099":"These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day!","4100":"MY kids loved these and they were such a great deal. I didn't feel so guilty about giving my kids chips!!","4101":"Like many others, we were on the fence about buying these Popchips, with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat.  Turns out though we enjoy them all, the kids like the plain ones, saying they taste like Pringles, and my wife and I are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt.  We are not fans of BBQ chips in general, but still ate the BBQ Popchips.  I will definitely be buying these again","4102":"Everyone should try these chips. They are healthier than regular chips. And they taste good.","4103":"This was our first time trying Popchips, but I had heard so many good things about them so I was eager to try them.  We ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors.  My kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar.  My favorite by far is the BBQ flavor.  We love popchips here!!!","4104":"These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. You get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer, they are GREAT, only 2 points for each bag!!!","4105":"Possibly THE best salt and vinegar chips (healthy or not) ever!  The salt is just right and compliment the vinegar's tartness perfectly.  All the chips are good.. salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming.","4106":"This variety pack is perfect for when you want something crunchy and salty. The selection of flavors were great choices for me - I liked them all. The portion keeps you from overeating, and they are healthier for you than potato chips, even the baked ones. I recommend these and will be buying them again and again.","4107":"The popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. They are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. Great for dieters. Fits in with a low calorie diet. Definitely would recommend trying at least once.","4108":"Totally amazing and very delicious.  My favorite flavors (from best to worst):  1. barbecue 2. sour cream and onion 3. cheddar  4. salt and pepper 5. original 6.  vinegar and sea salt","4109":"Salt and Vinegar and BBQ rock!  Plain were OK....Didn't really care for Cheddar.  Nice to start w\/a variety pack to find the ones you prefer.","4110":"If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Suprisingly, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer. Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! This is a really nice product.","4111":"I got these for $10 for the 24 pack, so a pretty good deal. They are about as healthy as the baked chips I usually buy.  They all taste great and Im officially a fan.  It's pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked.  So they do have some \"air\" in them.  .8 ounce bags is slightly more than the .75 ounches in baked lays bags I was buying.  Good buy if you can get a good deal like I did","4112":"Popchips are a healthy and light alternative to regular potato chips.  They are full of flavor, and only 2 Weight Watcher points per delicious bag!  I have shared these chips with family and friends, and they are all now fans!<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001RVFDOO\">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)<\/a>","4113":"I am very pleased with these.  Note: they are kosher (kof k) Pareve!  At 100 calories \/ bag, they make a delicious snack.","4114":"Excellent taste for a low calorie snack.  This size bag is exactly 100 calories and you get a lot of chips.  I prefer these to the regular greasy chips.","4115":"I expected..idk..maybe tasteless cardboard...but these are really good..i have only tried the bbq so far..but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag!  I will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking..my only caveat is..these could prove to be addictive..i am looking to watch my weight..and these are definitely a temptation!  Very happy with this product:)","4116":"i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience! Thank you!","4117":"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!","4118":"I LUV me some POPCHIPS!!  These are great snack items.  I ordered a case, and passed them around my office.  Now everyone is addicted to these chips. I have not found anyone that did not like these chips...and they are healthier than the baked chips out there. YUMM!!","4119":"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches.","4120":"When I found these chips I was shocked to see how little fat there is in these. They taste great and the are actually not bad for you either. I told my sister, and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them. We order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines, the office loves them. They can be a little hard to find, that why I order the online.","4121":"This 24-pack lasted about a month, and I sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once, as it is my wife's and my favorite. So, I reordered just the barbecue. Great snack for 100 calories. I've purchased the reduced fat Pringles 100-calorie individual packs before, and you get a lot more chips in a Popchips bag than from Pringles.","4122":"Great product! All the flavors were delicious. Loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each.","4123":"I LOVE THESE CHIPS, I HAVE THEM ON AUTO ORDER EVERY 2 MONTHS, THEY TASTE GREAT, I CAN NOT BELIVE THE WHOLE BAG HAS 100 CALORIES, I HAVE A BAG EVERY DAY, IT SURE HAS HELPED MY WEIGHT LOSS BY HAVEING THEM IN LITTLE BAGS, SO I DO NOT EAT A HUGE AMOUNT","4124":"I am very impressed with the flavors. ALL OF THEM! There were a few flavors I wasn't sure I was going to like....but they are really good also! The flavors are very intense. You are not getting a bland chip. I'm on the monthly plan but I've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!","4125":"PopChips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips. I love all the flavors !! It's also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags.","4126":"Fabulous - tasty but not awful for you!  I've already recommended to folks I work with.  Will continue to purchase!","4127":"It is simple. These chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands. Way better than anything baked! I highly recommend them!","4128":"The Popchips were excellent - had excellent flavor and low in calories.  When you eat these - don't need another potato chip!","4129":"These chips are delicious and low in calories.  I love the salt and vinegar, and the barbeque.  We buy them by the case.  They are great.  Thanks for offering them.","4130":"I love pop chips and the variety pack was fantastic.  Delivered quickly - these chips are filling, full of flavor and way healthier than other types of chips.","4131":"The pop-chips are great. I had heard they were really good and I totally agree. I love being able to have all the flavors. I like the variety. The chips were delivered quickly and safely.","4132":"I love popchips and especially when they are in individual portion sizes and a variety of flavors...good for you and tastes great and are easy to put in lunches or snacks on the go!","4133":"If I had to describe a Popchip, I would say that it's a hybrid of a  potato chip and a popcorn cake.  I was a little skeptical, at first, since I was trying to figure out how they were made if they weren't baked or fried, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them.  This variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite(s).  If you're a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips, this are a must-try.","4134":"I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.  The best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  I hate rice hates but loved these (just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor)and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.  I recommend giving these a chance, they are a great healthy and quick snack.","4135":"For 100 calories a bag, these are the closest thing you will get to regular potato chips, they have great crunch and flavor.","4136":"the pop chips are really incredible. They are very flavorful and crispy. My Favorite is the BBQ, but that is just me, they are all good. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health.","4137":"these chips tatse great, and the serving size is good. we especially liked the variety pack with six flavors","4138":"I recently received the variety packs of popchips. i have them delivered to work and everyone just loves them.  i tried one flavor ...delicious, next flavor.... excellent, next flavor... oh my goodness, even better and it gets better and better.  Best snack in recent memory.  :)","4139":"Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer.","4140":"These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.","4141":"The reason why I ordered this on-line is because the only Pop Chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar & barbeque.  I LOVE the sour cream and onion ones - actually I love ALL of them, but it's great to have them in the 100 calorie bag, because if they weren't I wouldn't be able to stop eating them.","4142":"I love these chips...and my husband does too. He wipes them out before I can get to them. The variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like. They are packaged well and always fresh. The bag contains a generous portion. I've purchased many times and am never dissapointed.","4143":"This is a great chip replacement! Wow all the flavors are terrific,good with a sandwich, soup, or just a late night snack!","4144":"Pop Chips are the best chips I've had in a long time.  I'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points.  And when I buy a case of them they average I think about .94.  Not bad.","4145":"loved the assortment pack. everyone in family loves them.  low fat, lower calorie and all natural, simple snack for kid's lunch bags. It is peanut and tree nut free (safe for allergy kids) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat, I bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet.","4146":"I am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest, non-homemade chips I've ever had. Plus they're healthy! Only problem is I can't decide which flavor is my favorite.","4147":"I love these chips. They are excellent! On the Weight Watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is GREAT for potatoe chips. LOVE the single serving bags for portion control. Also love Amazon.com for selling them. Can't find them in the stores. I will be ordering these forever. Great product.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001RVFDOO\">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack of 24 [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging<\/a>]","4148":"I love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day.  The only thing bad about the Amazon price is they are about $20 for a 24 pack.  That is 80 cents each.  Sadly I discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine - for 75 cents.  I would expect to buy them for .50 a pack if I have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine.  I highly recommend these chips, but there is no savings buying the from Amazon.","4149":"Variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chips....popchips r half the fat and only 100 calories so a def must buy","4150":"I am in love with POP Chips! They are my go to low calorie snack! The largest 100 calorie pack out there!","4151":"These chips are very good. Wish we could purchase them in our area. Great chance to try them in this offer.","4152":"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME.","4153":"They were not bad tasting...........they served the purpose that I wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy","4154":"These chips are delicious and each bag only has 100 calories.  They are not fried but just baked and come in 6 different flavors.  For anyone who is dieting but loves potato chips these are great.","4155":"These are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips.  Not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the WHOLE bag it's ok!!!  Great product and I would highly recommend it anyone.","4156":"I originally found these at a Target out of my home town. I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher's plan. They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty. I could not find them where I live so I purchased them from the Pop Chips web site which took me through Amazon. Yummy!","4157":"These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!","4158":"Love, love, love these crunchy little treats.  They remind me of \"Munchos\" but without the greasy tounge afterwards.  I don't usually like flavored snacks, but these are all great, not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste.  I subscribe to them so I will never run out:)","4159":"What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers.","4160":"I really liked these chips.  They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.  The cheddar, bbq, and salt\/pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.  The chips are great - my brother still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.  Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos.","4161":"I love these chips so much... and I can't get over how delicious each variety is!! The price here is AWESOME too!","4162":"These chips are incredible! Enough can't be said about them. They are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories!","4163":"I love these chips! They always make a great healthy snack when I'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance.","4164":"Love these pop-chips! The variety bag was a great deal, especially with the $5 off.  Tasty, low fat- just what I needed as a healthy alternative for a great price. I highly recommend these!","4165":"Love All THE FLAVORS!!!!! JUST THE RIGHT SIZE PACKAGE AND TASTE GREAT!!!!! GIVE THEM A TRY YOU WILL LOVE THEM ALSO!!!!!","4166":"I discovered Pop Chips a year or so ago, and my whole family LOVES them!  We are partial to crunchy, salty snacks (like potato chips) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload.  These are a perfect substitute!  Great to tide you over between meals, or with a sandwich, or a movie-watching snack.  The small size bags are perfect for NOT getting too carried away, too!","4167":"I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it.","4168":"I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured \"what the heck!\". WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!!","4169":"I shared these with my two older sons, then ordered more. These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work.","4170":"in my book. You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections. The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet.","4171":"they taste awesome! esp the salt n pepper one! I love them and they are really healthy! the packaging is really good..","4172":"These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories\/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips.","4173":"We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!","4174":"Popchips are an excellent snack. I really like all of the varieties. I use Amazon's subscription plan and save some $$  -  I get 1 24-pack box per month, shipped automatically. Life is grand!","4175":"Popchips are phenomenal!  Unfortunately, just not readily available at a retailer near you.  Ordering online is the next best, especially with Amazon Prime service! My dad loved his boxes of Popchips.  I'm happy, as his daughter, to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep.","4176":"I am enjoying the recent purchase of PopChips, so far I have enjoyed all the flavor choices.  The individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if I have a craving for a snack.  Thanks for the product. Jean Roth","4177":"I'm really glad Amazon carries these, they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too.  We haven't found a flavor we didn't like yet.  I'll probably use the Amazon subscribe feature to get another $3 off as we will go through these fairly regularly.  Awesome chips!","4178":"these are the best chips I have every tasted They are Healthy for4 you & have Great flavor  I will buy often I eat 1 bag a day with my Lunch  Yummy !!!","4179":"This chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover.  All the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt.","4180":"Great Chips - No after taste... Seem to be much better for me. Need to buy the big bags now.","4181":"Amazing concept... not fried, not even baked... Popped like Popcorn... !!!! This is another product for my Weight Watchers regima. Each bag is only 2 points.. I love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch. They taste really good.. my favorite are the Bar-b-que, Salt & Vinegar, and the Sour Cream.. they are all good though.","4182":"I ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and I'm so glad I did. All of the flavors are tasty and satisfying. At 100 calories a bag, they are a great snack. They quell that hunger for crunchy, salty, goodness without killing my diet. Yes, they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips, but it stops me from eating just a couple more and 1 bag is really enough to keep me happy. I've got a new favorite chip.","4183":"I HAPPENED UPON THIS ITEM IN MY LOCAL DELI AND BEING CURIOS I DECIDED TO TRY.  THEY WERE FABULOUS BETTER THAN THE REGULAR CHIPS BY FAR.  I GIVES YOU SATISFACTION OF CRUNCH AND FLAVOR IN A POTATOE CHIP.  GREAT GREAT FIND.","4184":"The chips are good with fast service but I ordered a case(24) of Popchips 6-flavor Variety Pack and received 24 bags all Barbecue flavored.","4185":"The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi-grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood.","4186":"The cheddar tastes a little weird, but that could be personal preference. The salt and vinegar is very strong, but tastes okay other than that.  Salt and pepper is yum!  Barbeque is good too.  Plain is plain.  If you're a die hard potato chip lover and don't care about calories, don't bother with these.  However, if you want your salty snacks and don't want all the calories, these work.  I'd buy them again.","4187":"I have been on weight watcher's for about 13 months.  I have lost 60 pounds.  The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.  They are only 2 points plus on weight watcher's.  They go great with every meal (salad,soup,sandwich,etc). I can not live without them.  So i say BUY BUY BUY AND BUY","4188":"Love these!  I'm not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy.  A little like Pringles but much tastier.","4189":"I am so happy to have discovered these chips. I hate stealing a phrase from another product, but they melt in your mouth. I have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.Just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag, air popped chips. Do try them people!","4190":"Love the chips, nice 100 +\/- calorie snack, reminds me of Munchos, but less greasy, flavors are good (salt & vinegar least favorite). And they've started shipping APO--thank you and my family thanks you (so they don't have to get the package and reship!) Made my day.","4191":"Wow, these are remarkably tasty chips.  I discovered them through Weight Watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat. But they are high in flavor and umami. I am now a big fan!","4192":"These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.  The \"Original\" style taste exactly like Munchos, but don't come with the high calorie count.  The other flavors (Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Salt & Pepper, Cheddar, and BBQ) are all delicious, as well.","4193":"We liked these.  Quite good, even if they're 'healthy' @ 100 calories & 3 whole fat grams a bag. My favorites are the plain, the others are very strong flavored, very zippy!","4194":"Love these chips.  They are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all.  There is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped.  The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag, but there are lots of chips in the bag so it's a great snack.  The ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added.  Fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq.","4195":"These are the greatest potato snack products I've found.  Only 2 points for Weight Watchers.  Really crispy and tasty.  All of the flavors are great.  My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors, but I guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it's a great trade off.  I would recommend these chips to everyone.","4196":"I really like these chips.  They have a different texture than regular potato chips but I still find it really tasty.  Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things \"healthy\" and \"low fat\" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people.","4197":"Wow, these chips are delicious!  They're low in calorie and carb count. I can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil-smothered grocery store chips.  The sour cream & onion, salt & vinegar, and cheddar are my favorites!  If you're weight conscience, want something healthy, or just want something that tastes good, buy these chips! You won't be disappointed!","4198":"It felt weird ordering 24 bags of chips off the internet that I had never even tried before, but I am SO GLAD I DID. They are delicious! I've tried 4 flavors so far & have loved each one. These are a win. :)","4199":"We have these suto delivered.  They are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size.  Great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors.","4200":"These are my favorite chips! The BBQ and Salt & Pepper are the best!  The texture of these things ROCK!  All nicely packaged.  Gluten free if you care. I don't but some have commented on that.","4201":"These chips are tasty and low in calorie.  If you are gluten free they are a great option as a to-go snack.  We love them.","4202":"The product arrived quickly. All bags and chips were in place...and safe ;-D These chips are delicious and only four WW points!","4203":"Overall the chips were very tastey. My pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me. Some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations. Try it and see for yourelf, Enjoy.","4204":"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as \"regular\" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!","4205":"I ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal. This size bag is perfect for snacking. The assortment of chips is great, there's something in there for everyone.","4206":"Love pop chips! The assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties I  wanted. Did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great!","4207":"Delicious, light and full of flavor. It's difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is, but BBQ is amazing! I was impressed with the packaging, but I can't imagine it is too cost efficient or eco-friendly. That is my only complaint. Great product and guilt-free snacking.","4208":"Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ, Original, Salt & Vinegar and Sour cream & onion chips are superb!","4209":"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!","4210":"I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!","4211":"I loved this product, and it was better than what I thought it was going to be. My favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor (yum yum) but I hated the cheddar, and salt & pepper ones.","4212":"I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.  I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.  If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker.","4213":"+Really really tasty +Much healthier than almost every other potato chip +A variety of flavors, consider this a huge sampler  -Sea Salt & Vinegar is crazy sour. Personally, I think they overdid it on the vinegar. -It's hard to stop at one serving, but I take this as a sign of a good snack :P","4214":"My subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged.  I love the fact that I receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying. The way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect! Having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right!!!  Thank you,","4215":"These were awesome!! They have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling. I bought the variety pack to try all the flavors. Didn't care for the salt and pepper, but loved the rest. Will definitely buy more!","4216":"It is so wonderful to eat Pop Chips.  I am a loyal fan and will continue.  Tasty AND Healthy.  \/the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices.","4217":"what can I say... if you've had popchips in the past and love them... then no better place to pick them up... I love these chips and have bought them without an issue from Amazon.  Thanks","4218":"I won them off a penny auction site. My 2 year old likes them plenty. I don't think there is any potato flavor, they taste more like ricecakes to me, but are ok. The salt and vinegar is strong holy cow!!","4219":"I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.  The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack.","4220":"These are such a treat when you are craving that salty, crunchy snack. And the multi-box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. Share it with son so they don't get stale but not much chance of that.  One of my \"3 Points plus\" Weight Watchers Snacks that I don't run out of!","4221":"Got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store. This was a great buy. Thanks, Amazon!","4222":"I have subscribed these chips. They are so tasty. Not dry or oily. Cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.","4223":"I love these chips. They are so delicious, it is so hard to eat just one bag. All the flavors allow you to taste them all.  My favorite flavor is the cheese ones. Go ahead and try them.  They are so delicious.","4224":"I found these chips originally at a local market.  However, I have been unable to find them since.  WHEW!  what a relief when I was able to locate them.  These chips have so much flavor, they're not greasy and they are crunchy.  I am a chip-a-holic and these are by far the best chips I have ever eaten.","4225":"These chips are great. Delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips. I have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious. I found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. All the flavors were to my liking. The only con about this is that THEY ARE ADDICTING!!!. You are warned! I purchased these through Amazon.","4226":"these are the best chips ever. I will buy them again, wish more stores had them.The plain chips are my fav.","4227":"I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content. I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted.","4228":"Yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! I am not a big health food person, I'll take the grease if it makes it taste better. These are 100x better than those baked chips. My brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked I mail him while deployed. Only draw back to these chips, they are definitely not for dipping.","4229":"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal\/bag, 3.5g fat\/bag","4230":"The chips were delicious. I didn't care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great. Didn't have any guilt eating this healthier snack.","4231":"I eat a bag of these every single day!  They are the best tasting good for you snack! Everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked.","4232":"These are quite tasty and delicious, I love them....BUT the prices here are RIDICULOUS!!! Did I say Ridiculous? Oh So RIDICULOUS!!! But Im here to rate the product not the price...5 Stars for the Product.","4233":"A little costly but they are good and fresh too, not stale at all. Would recomend to any Cheetos fan.","4234":"This product works great for me.  I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush. This thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when I'm ready to cook.","4235":"I have had my herb savor for a few weeks now, and I was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad, so I could tell you how long it takes, but it never happened. For the first time ever, I used all of the herbs before they went bad. I have not had any problems with leaking. Everything closes up nice and tight on mine. Plus, this thing just looks really cool!","4236":"I've had trouble storing fresh basil because I learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge.  My cat is attracted to anything in the plant family (with disasterous results).  This keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it!","4237":"I bought one of these about 4 or 5 months ago - and I LOVE it!  I have kept a combination of Rosemary, Thyme and parsley.  They have all kept fresh for more than 4 WEEKS!  No brown spots, no rotten leaves - just perfect.  I Highly recommend this product - no problems with leaks or the plug not holding.","4238":"Actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two. Thats enough reason for me to buy! Before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and I would have to toss them out. This saves me money and a trip to the market!","4239":"I was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit (which I normally won't touch).  In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work, so that I can have a fruit snack easily even if I was too busy or forgot to bring lunch.  So far I haven't gotten a can that had any problems.  The watermelon isn't crunchy - of course not! - but it's good, and certainly not \"slimy\".","4240":"This is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream.  It is my husband's new favorite dessert.  I don't find the texture off-putting.  Of course, is isn't as crunchy as fresh fruit, but the taste is great.  If I can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an A in my book!","4241":"My 1 yr old Granddaughter, and I cannot get enough. and it is good for you!","4242":"I'm a big fan of the Dirty Martini - but I simply can't eat enough olives to keep up!  Love this stuff - Not quite as tangy as Dirty Sue, but still very vibrant.","4243":"We have reorderd this product many times...makes a great dirty martini..delivery is prompt, product well packed","4244":"This is an excellent product.  We always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis.  Now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better!","4245":"the last case (a different brand)we ordered from Amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case.  However, the Boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini.","4246":"If you like Bloody Mary 's and dirty martinies this is a must. You won't be sorry. I'm so glad I found this product.","4247":"This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli. This stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. I would highly recommend this product.","4248":"He never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives, we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat, just buying the juice makes alot of sense.","4249":"Excellent service & price for the product, order shipped quickly & received in good condition. Will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good. You really can't beat the price.","4250":"The olive juice I purchased was not only inexpensive, but has a great flavor.  I have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis, but I could not find anyone that carried it.  thanks Amazon.","4251":"This product is great if you want a dirty martini, I highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine.","4252":"We use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say","4253":"Love this Balance Blend of Oils , especially in mix batters such as : Pancake , Cornbread ,Cake , Etc... , a good oil to ingest !","4254":"I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :( So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.  I carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good. Also the tin is very cute.","4255":"Can't live without these little jewels.  Not only is there a surprise in the middle, but it takes me right to the French countryside while enjoying them.","4256":"A family favorite.  These are really unique treats.  The wonderful taste of flowers.  The violet and rose are great.  Orange blossom wasn't to my liking.  The company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years.  They are made in a small French town that was featured in a movie called \"Chocolat.\"","4257":"I love these.  I love any floral flavored product. The best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever,  offer these but don't tell the flavor.  The reactions are YouTube worthy.","4258":"I ordered these candies for the first time and I am hooked, they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming. I really enjoy them. Highly recommended! Unique candy!","4259":"The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.  One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1\/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1\/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.  Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.","4260":"i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient. i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again, and considering its healthy use for sure.","4261":"I bought this because my husband wanted to try the French sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show.  The grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it.  I did not realize, however, that it is not \"iodized\" and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily iodine.","4262":"I really liked the taste. It is well priced too. It is a great and healthy alternative to table salt. I even used it on salad.","4263":"This is a fabulous gift! I ordered 3 and kept one to try-and they are awesome! The presentation is great, chocolates delicate, creamy, crunchy, and tasty, easy to eat, not heavy. For a mass produced line, this is a real winner. Better than most out there in its price range. Love the 3 different flavors. Will buy again. Great hostess gift.","4264":"I ordered this for a friend at South Carolina for Christmas, i want her to try some Italian chocolates, lol!  The item was arrived earlier than expected, but, nevertheless, it was well packed and only melts on her mouth, she totally loves it.  Three different taste and flavors of Ferreros guarantees to give three different yummy joy, Mmmmm....","4265":"This item was received early.  It was packaged well and in excellent shape!  This was a gift and I am sure it will be received well.  After all, Ferrero chocolates..what's not to like!!!  Thanks for the excellent service.  Would use this seller again and would highly recommend!!","4266":"I bought this as my first pack of K-cups, its definitely a good buy! Assortments are always a little more expensive, this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5, thank god they picked decaf for the small one! Great coffee, if I hadn't discovered club keurig I would still be buying these!","4267":"I use these for training treats.  I have a large and small dog and this works for both of them.  They are all natural and my pups love the taste.  I highly recommend these!  I also tried the Three Dog Bakery Apple Oatmeal Woofers and those were a big hit.","4268":"GREAT CANDY AS ALWAYS FROM WERTHER'S ORIGINAL CANDY, HARD OR CHEWY CARAMELS ARE BUT TWO OF THE CANDY THEY MAKE THAT IS OUTSTANDING. IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN NOT KEEP IT IN STOCK AND ARE ALWAYS OUT OR JUST HAVE A BAG OR TWO LEFT TO SALE.","4269":"I reviewed Werther's original chewy caramels, caramel chocolates, and creamy filled hard caramels as a BzzAgent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the original hard candies.  Still has that great unique caramel flavor from Werther's but now in a chewable form.  I prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last a little longer but these are a nice second choice.","4270":"I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.  I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5\/8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full-size Belgian waffle maker.  Easy to make and very tasty.","4271":"Nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by Stonewall kitchen.  My mom complained about the price but I think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake\/waffle mix.  The waffle comes out golden and crispy.  I was using the Presto 03510 FlipSide Waffle Maker.","4272":"I have been making Belgian waffles using the Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix for over three years.  My waffles are undoubtedly the best ever!!!  I like my waffles light and crisp - I can't stand a heavy soggy waffle. These just melt in your mouth.  I have made homemade waffles, but I have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix.","4273":"This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you don't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven.","4274":"I have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work.  So you have to add an egg & a little butter!  It is well worth it.  I am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime.  They are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My family loves, loves them.  The only thing different I do is instead of the extra 2 tbsp of water they call for, I add 2 tbsp of vanilla in place of. Best waffle mix!!","4275":"I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, it's not great. I believe my waffles made from Bisquick were just as tasty as these, and this costs quite a bit more. The instructions ARE very easy to follow though, and I DO like the canister for storage.","4276":"I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them.","4277":"What can i say??  They are wonderful, and the highlight of each weekend.  OHHHhhh  - use soda water for the liquid !  even better !!!","4278":"I usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that doesn't taste \"off\" to me.  This mix is the best!!!  My family and I love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy.","4279":"This is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make.","4280":"My family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix. The texture and taste is the best out there, especially when using our waffle maker. You can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish. Your price is great and delivery can't be beat. We recommend it to everyone!!","4281":"I love Belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch.  They are really good, and I'm fussy.  I haven't tried them as pancakes yet.","4282":"These pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like I am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. Splurge on this and the good maple syrup...it really is cheaper than going to Denny's or IHOP where a meal for two will be $20 minimum.","4283":"Let me start by saying my family loves this stuff.  It has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla.  It cooks up nicce and light.  My problem with this product is the recent price increase.  It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own.","4284":"My family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend.  My daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone I fix them for thinks they are outstanding.","4285":"I'm sorry not everyone likes this mix, but we love it. It is like going to a gourmet restaurant! (yeah - a gourmet WAFFLE restaurant...) The waffles taste and turn out great, and so easy. Hard for us to believe, but it seems it's not for everyone.","4286":"This is the pancake mix we go to when we don't have buttermilk in the fridge (don't think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh) to make Alton Brown's buttermilk pancake recipe.  This Stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far! It might cost more, but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes.","4287":"Stonewall Kitchen products are a big favorite at our house.  This pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat.  We add fresh blueberries to them, and top them with the Stonewall Blueberry Syrup, which you can buy on their website.  They make wonderful jams and jellies too, as well as sauces, and flavored syrups.  Try this pancake mix though, you won't be disappointed!","4288":"This is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by Amazon so I bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase.  It makes the best waffles every time I have used it and that being said I am sold on this product.  I will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical.","4289":"I have been using this pancake and waffle mix for about 5 or 6 years and I have to say this is the best.  The waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  I've tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix.  I use the Waring Pro Waffle Maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime.  I follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results.","4290":"This is THE king of pancake mixes.  Easy, foolproof, and delicious, it makes the best pancakes I've ever tasted.  We've been buying it for several years, and the pancakes consistently come out light and delicious.  Simply add an egg, buttermilk, and melted butter.  Cook them on a nice hot skillet for a yummy anytime meal!","4291":"Makes perfect, delicious, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, waffles in minutes. Worth every penny!","4292":"I purchased this mix to use with my new Presto FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker and am very pleased with the results.  It took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large Belgian Waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes!  The flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like Bisquick.  I'll be buying more, for sure!","4293":"I received this as a gift a few weeks ago.  It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had.  The taste and consistancy is excellent.  Blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in.  You pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion","4294":"Makes very good, light waffles. Seems to be exactly the same as Carbon's Golden Malted waffle mix. Only this is more expensive.","4295":"Bought this mix along with the Cuisinart waffle maker.  Delicious.  We followed the directions and it made only one Belgian waffle.  The next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount.  Good flavor and easy to use.","4296":"I have a Waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use. I tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mix.  It was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor ... loved the malt flavor that came through.  I will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out.","4297":"This mix makes great tasting waffles.  A little extra work and expense but worth it.  Need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make 2 full waffles on my new Presto Flipside Belgian Waffle Maker.","4298":"Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is our favorite.  Consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor.  The 33 ounce cans are a Good value for the quality. I highly recommend this product.","4299":"This mix is the kids' and family favorite. It tastes like vanilla. It's wonderful for pancakes or waffles.","4300":"This waffle and pancake mix is delicious!  You can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them.  They are the only pancakes\/waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking!","4301":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001E5E29A\">Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 2)<\/a>  The family said they were the best that I had made. The 10 Grandchildren ate all that was served to them. The parents, who I have served pancakes to for a long, also said they were the best they have eaton. It was good to see the little ones clean up their plates.","4302":"We have pancakes once a week and this is our go-to mix. It is incredibly easy to prepare, and I add a handful of chocolate chips, pieces of banana\/strawberries\/peach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan. No need to buy different flavors you can customize it yourself.","4303":"We first had Stonewall Waffle Mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago.  We have been using it ever since.  The flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world.  We won't ever go back to Bisquick for our waffles!","4304":"This has become a breakfast staple for our home. Now nearly every Sunday morning, we are making pancakes. We've got the Vermont Mapel syrup, eggs, sausage or bacon and we're set for the day with a just a light snack-type dinner. Use bettermilk for the absolute best results.","4305":"Great mixed for Belgium waffles, family thinks it's the best.  Must try it and order it from Amazon.  I let friends know to use this product.","4306":"I found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix 1 star, I had to read those reviews. Two of them seem like ads for Robs Red Mill, and the other one didn't make any sense. You must be looking for pancakes or waffles, so do yourself a favor and give these a go. They are delicious","4307":"The entire family loved this pancake mix. It was easy to make and tasted great. We tried it with syrup, powdered sugar, as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote. I would definately purchase this again. The only problem is my family wants this every weekend and I have to double to feed my large family. It gets expensive quickly, so I do not order it as often as they would like.","4308":"we love this pancake \/ waffle mix.  It's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick.  Crispy, light, tender, yummy!","4309":"This was the best pancake\/waffle mix ever! Wonderful for breakfast or dinner. It was a great price and worth it! My husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles I made and ate them fast--I could hardly keep up. Definitely recommend Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse pancake and waffle mix! You do have to add a few ingredients, but it is well worth the effort.","4310":"This product is great.  Just add egg, water, and butter (I used oil).  I will never make waffles from scratch again.","4311":"We made this purchase based on our daughter's recommendation and it is as good as she promised. We have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. We add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous!","4312":"I have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet.  I have also made them from scratch. I like my waffles with NO Sugar in them, because I don't like too much sugar.  This mix is very good.  Waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare.","4313":"We received a gift box that contained the Stonewall Farms Pancake Mix and they were out of this world. They are the lightest, fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste.  And the price on Amazon is a big savings over ordering from Stonewall Farms.  Don't shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time.","4314":"This lands in the gormet category for sure.  Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.  They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.","4315":"I'm not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix.  It's quick, easy, and produces delicious waffles.  Yes, it's pricier than some of the other mixes on Amazon but I think it's worth it.","4316":"This is a great mix. I mixed it with milk instead of water.  Just follow the directions.","4317":"I originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack.  When my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately.  It is super yummy waffle mix.  The waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them.  Here I am on amazon.com placing yet another order for this Waffle mix, it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyone's favorite breakfast item.","4318":"We are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better!  Sunday is pancake day at our house, and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  This mix holds fresh blueberries nicely - don't over-mix the ingredients and you will get nice, fluffy fruit-filled (or not) pancakes that are absolutely first-rate.","4319":"We first received Stonewall pancakes as a gift. We have ordered them 2x on Amazon who has the best prices. Highly recommend this product. Will return here to buy more...","4320":"I bought this on a whim because I found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it. I didn't expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix. This is so much better.  It's easy to use and makes moist, fluffy pancakes that are to die for. I am never buying Bisquick again.","4321":"I have used this product for a few years now. This being the first time from Amazon. I'm glad it was there. This is by far the best pancake\/waffle mix on the market bar NONE !","4322":"The pancakes were delicious, but they weren't as fluffy as the ones I normally make.  Next time I use this, I'm going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps.","4323":"I found these at a super Gold Box pricing one day otherwise I would not have looked twice at 16.00 pancake mix.  Now we are hooked - nothing compares to this mix.  I've tried every box in the store for our belgian waffle maker and these top them all! Waffles are nice and crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. They are so dense they don't absorb syrup or toppings.  I will buy this over and over again.","4324":"No matter how you mess up the recipe, this Mix still makes my family happy in the Sunday morning :)","4325":"I hope Amazon restocks this item always.I can't stand the other brands out there since it got this brand.And the price is right at Amazon to.","4326":"Heavily touted by the reviews, decided to try.  Mix is good, but not great.  Probably wouldn't buy again.","4327":"This is the best pancake mix!  I've sent this to several people, and they all love it. The two-pack makes a nice little gift.","4328":"I'm not sure why, but this is our favorite pancake & waffle mix.  Just tastes the best to us.","4329":"I hope Amazon always carries this product too. I have ordered it twice. Excellent product for the price. Yum-O!","4330":"very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer.","4331":"There are some types I really like--especially Southern Sweet Tea (which is actually a lot less sweet than Southerners really make it).  The raspberry and peach are also good, and not overly sweet.  Urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage.  I did not care for the herbals, and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment--but I found friends who like those flavors.  It was to taste test, and it was fine for that.  I don't think I will buy assortments again, as I have found what I really like.","4332":"I got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although Yuban is our everyday coffee. Well this was a surprise! Nice and flavorful, not bitter, smooth and maybe not as strong as Yuban in the same amounts the was all there. If they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price I would buy more but as is its very pricey.","4333":"This was a new product to me.  They were very tasty, crisp, and surprisingly delicious.  I was very pleased with this product.","4334":"I was very pleased to stumble upon this brand, as it is difficult to find \"healthy\" snacks for families that don't contain GMO ingredients. These were a big hit with kids and grown-ups alike; added bonus that they are low in calories and gluten-free. I would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor, as well as the brand in general. Great new company!","4335":"This product was a gift to a far distant relative.  It arrived right on schedule, in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket.  I cannot attest to the food personally, but she loved it!","4336":"I always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter.  And since I also had discovered I was allergic to wheat, I wanted and needed an alternative.  I originally found these Kame Rice Crunch crackers in Kroger supermarkets.  From the first bite, I loved them, and I wished I had discovered them years ago.  The plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste, and they are perfectly crunchy and light.  I've occasionally had a hard time finding them, so I'm THRILLED that Amazon is now carrying them.  Give these a try, they are delicious!!","4337":"These things are addicting and low in calories and fat too.  I love the Wasabi flavor.","4338":"I would recomend this product for it's fine qualities and taste really good. Very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake.","4339":"THESE CRACKERS ARE A GREAT SNACK! NO CHOLESTORAL, AND THEY USE SEA SALT. VERY CRUNCHY, SO ITS LIKE EATING POTATO CHIPS, BUT BETTER FOR YOU. COMES IN DIFFERENT FLAVORS, BUT I PREFER THE PLAIN. I HAVE FOUND THAT THE SALT CONTENT IS DIFFERENT ON SOME PURCHASES, SOMETIMES VERY SALTY AND SOMETIMES HARDLY ANY SALT, MUST BE A PROBLEM ON THE PRODUCTION LINE. THESE CRACKERS BECOME ADDICTING, BUT ITS OK CAUSE RICE IS GOOD FOR US!","4340":"I'm so dissapointed these are unavailable right now! I LOVE these crackers with cream cheese - it's my favorite snack! I hope they become available again soon! I can't find them anywhere!","4341":"I got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time. To me, they taste just like corn nuts. They are quite hard, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like hard foods. They are crispy and delicious snacks tho. Will buy more. :D","4342":"This is an excellent product for the non-gluten diet.  They're good alone as a snack, or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches.  Excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten.  Only criticism - wish the price would come down.","4343":"Not as good as Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, but these are available at least. They are VERY good. More healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch. Mmmmmmmm . . .","4344":"First time buyer of KA-ME Rice Crackers and I'm very impressed. These are very light, crisp and flavorful. They are as good plain as they are with cold cuts, fruit, etc. Unfortunately, the ones I purchased may be the last I get from this source. Right after I purchased the dozen packs, the price per dozen increased 44% to its present $37.99. Fortunately, I have enough to last a while, but assuming the price stays the same, these are my last KA-ME.","4345":"Crackers are great.  Was glad to find them. There is a good selection of flavors.  My favorite is salted, but there are other choices.","4346":"Local availability of the Plain variety of these crackers has been unpredictable with stores trimming inventory and dropping all but the highest volume SKUs. Buying on subscription makes it affordable and, so far, reliable.","4347":"These rice crackers are truly delicious w\/cheese or Peanut butter.  Also I can eat crackers w\/o Gluten. As I am allergic to wheat, eggs, Gluten, and Bannas. This is my favorite snack on Sunday nights. They come promptly and save me money. Thank you. J. Wolf","4348":"I love these crackers!  Perfect snack for when I need something salty\/crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack.  I eat them a lot to hold me over between meals.  The price on amazon is great compared to my local markets.  Highly recommended!","4349":"Bottom line, these crackers are a great snack.  Ordering by the case saves some money compared to the $3.45 charged locally.  Whether plain, onion, or sesame (I've never tried the wasabi) these are a low fat, reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it.  The only sad thing is that I first ordered them in 2008 for $21 per case.","4350":"I too have begun to drink only Penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water.  I find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website [...] and I get free shipping.  I feel better overall and wish I could get this stuff by the gallon.  Great Product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.","4351":"You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.  I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.","4352":"I love this water.  It is very uplifting.  I feel better drinking it.  It is arsenic free, flouride free, chromium 6 free, chlorine free,and mtbe free-something about reverse osmosis and medicinal grade oxygen really works.  At work, we are no longer allowed to drink soda in our classrooms, so I bought some Penta water. I am hooked.  I like the one liter size bottles.  I wish you would sell those also!  I was lucky to purchase this at Dorthy Lane Market!  Buy this water!","4353":"These are my most favorite nut snacks. Sunflower is my absolute favorite, but the almond, cashew (very buttery and rich), and seasame are really great, too.  Have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them.  Great for the kiddos, too!","4354":"I love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. It has been very hard to find in any stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It still has the same flavor after all of these years. Try this candy if you love coconut. You will love it too!","4355":"I am a mom of 3 kids. With my older two I had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didn't have so much sodium! When my 3rd came along, HappyFamily introduced HappyMunchies. I was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too! And to top it off, it is organic so I know it is free of pesticide residue and GMOs!","4356":"Baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option. We have tried other brands (Gerber) but this is her favorite by far and I don't feel bad giving them to her as I know that they are high quality. Hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well :)","4357":"I've bought them many times. Good quality and good taste, baby love it, and I love it too. Reccommend it.","4358":"While I worry that I am teaching my baby to be a snacker, these are perfect for the in-between times for my 1 year old grazer. The label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative. I like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal, etc. I don't think they taste awesome, but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear. That makes me happy!","4359":"We love these. The cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor. My daughter, age 2, likes them both, but because we snack on them in the car I opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too. I love that they are healthy and I can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things. Love em","4360":"My two boys love the Happy Munchies Cheddar Cheese\/Carrot. They request them as their snack as they watch their \"show\" on t.v. I love that they are low in sodium, includes 25mg of choline per serving (which is great for their eyes)and tastes great. Also, they are Kosher certified which is a plus as well. I love to put these in baggies and keep them in my purse for emergency snacks on the go. Healthy, crunchy and a must buy.","4361":"My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go.","4362":"These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!","4363":"My son is only 9mo, so he can't say it yet, but he LOVES these.  He gets excited when I even take them out of the pantry!! I like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots.","4364":"My son loves them and I can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so won't choke and they are good for him too.","4365":"Happybaby Happymunchies Baked Organic Cheese and Veggie Snack, Cheddar Cheese\/Carrot, 1.63 Ounces (Pack Of 6)  Hello, this is six items should be installed, but I only received a, I with amazon contact but nobody reason I, please verify as soon as possible, give me reissue, thank you!!!!","4366":"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing. I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices. Enjoy!","4367":"I love Plum organic pouch.  Got this one on sale.  My baby and toddler LOVE this so much.  My 3 years old always ask me for more.","4368":"My son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips.  A lot of time I can't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son (he is 1) can eat.  These are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch.  Just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess.","4369":"Have had other brands like this before, and have always enjoyed them.  These were a really good bargain on sale.","4370":"My 8 month old loves this & has no problem holding it & sucking the food out.  This is great for on the go!","4371":"this makes feeding on the go so easy! my one-year-old will suck down a pouch in 5 minutes and she loves them!","4372":"I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day.  This does the trick!  He loves them and he can feed himself.  What more can I say?  (Oh, I actually tried one, and they really are good!)","4373":"Not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice. Great to throw in a diaper bag or purse. Spendy but definitely a good deal when it's on sale.","4374":"Delicious and nutritious! We live for coconut and nut treats since we don't eat grains. When I want to splurge, I pick up a bag of these from Whole Foods or my local indie health store. They average around $10 here unless they're on sale. :) I'd looove to be able to buy these in bulk. YUM YUM!","4375":"I am just passing along the 5-star rating from our three Miniature Schnauzers. This stuff is a big hit at our house. We give them each an easy to digest kibble that's good for them and put a tablespoon of Pot Pie on top. No more turned up noses now - they wolf it all down. Be sure to mix it up real good before serving.","4376":"I just switched from Merrick Whole Earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by Merrick and my dog loves it!  This a great for dogs that like \"human\" food.","4377":"We adopted an 8-year-old Dalmatian earlier this year, and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet. But we couldn't pass up trying a can of this dog food--sadly, just because of the name. Well, she loves it! So now it's her special occasion food. We mix half a can with a cup of dry, 2X\/day, with no nasty side effects. She also likes Wingaling and the Napa Valley offerings from this company. It's high in protein and works for us!","4378":"so happy we found this online for a reasonable price.  my two dogs love this stuff and it doesn't upset their stomachs.  Plus I love that it's not made in china or something.  when you look at the food, it looks pretty close to people food. You can see real chunks of chicken and veggies.  I don't want to give my dogs any manufactured stuff but also don't have the time to make our own dog food.","4379":"I give Merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog's dry kibble (and the cat even gets a taste) every now and then.  The Chicken Pot Pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie I can remember.","4380":"My dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening.  Accordingly, he will not eat plain kibble.  A scoop of this on his dry food, a little water to make gravy and we're good to go.  Ordering a case from Amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store, too.  All in all, a success for us.","4381":"This canned food has real chunks of chicken in it.  Dogs love it.  Looks and smells better than human-quality canned beef stew (like Dinty Moore).","4382":"Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.","4383":"This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.","4384":"The tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. The tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. The bags are flimsy, but I just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries. I will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection.","4385":"I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.","4386":"Not much else to say... I keep a box in my desk here at work, and I can enjoy a cup anytime!  Nice flavor, and no bitterness, so I can drink it straight without sugar!  Pros:  Flavor and value.  Cons:  It can't do my taxes for me... that's really about all I can think of.  lol","4387":"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!","4388":"this is a high quality oolong tea and i can't go back to bigelow, that's for sure! the taste is great, it is said to have slimming benefits, and the tea bags are a higher quality that don't come apart easily.","4389":"I got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. So I chucked them in a zip-lock when I got home. 3 mos. later I opened it and had some today. I am online trying to find more.","4390":"You just can't beat the taste of the original Dubble Bubble Gumballs! It really doesn't matter that the taste only last a minute or so, but that is why I bought the tub! The  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in A+++ condition! If your longing for the classic taste go for it! You will not be dissappointed!","4391":"Using the entire sauce packet is over kill, leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton. Otherwise noodles are well made, and sauce is reasonably well flavored. Quick and easy, a no brainer.","4392":"This is pretty good stuff. You can't expect a whole lot from instant box-o-noodles, but this is the best out of all the other brands I've tried before. The noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well. I'm going to buy more.","4393":"\"It tastes better than it looks\" was the first thing I said the a skeptical co-worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave.  Unfortunately, it's as fattening as it looks, so I likely won't be purchasing it often.  I could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though!","4394":"while its not traditional satay  it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry, i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine, i will buy again","4395":"I adore this brand of peanut satay noodles.  Unlike the other ethnic-foods-in-box, Ka-Me's noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious.  However, there's certainly a downside.  This dish is greasy, fattening, and high in calories.  If you read the nutritional information, you'll find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very filling.  My advice?  Split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice.  The sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it bleeds into the rice.  An instant and tasty multi-dish meal!","4396":"A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.  Gary Peterson","4397":"I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.","4398":"The pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition.  I encountered this as an ingredient in a Mollie Katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint.  We thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue, and got many rave reviews from our guests, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike.  I recommend both the vendor and this item.","4399":"Fast, professional transaction.  I needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great!  Now I just need to find more uses for this stuff.","4400":"Only Pom.Mol.I've ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the Chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish. It seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the Chef used was a brighter red color.","4401":"I have two recipes I'm anxious to try that call for pomegranate molasses. I've called all the specialty and best markets in the Sacramento area and no one's heard of this, much less carries it.  It's common in Mediterranean recipes, goes with shrimp, fish, chicken, beef and pork. I was delighted to find it on Amazon and look forward to using mine in a fabulous short ribs recipe.  I'm also passing along the info to my friends so they can order their own -- or I may give as gifts to my gourmet cook friends.","4402":"I would recommend this product.  I received it in a timely manner and the price was good.","4403":"Always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip - this brand of tahini I'd never tried before or seen in supermarkets, so I decided to order and try it....excellent by itself or in recipes! Highly recommended.","4404":"This was a very good puchase. The shipper was very fast and very friendly. The Tahini was very fresh and of good quality. I will order again.","4405":"We love to make Hummus, and love to make sandwitches, salad dressings. One of our kids favorite foods is Tahini over cold Undon Noodles.","4406":"I have never used Tahini before - and my hummus was good, but always, something was missing... After I found out of Tahini, I ordered it (and it was shipped extremelly fast)and used it. The result was amazing! One spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag (1lb beans) and I had my favorite ready to go!","4407":"We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.","4408":"This product arrived in a timely manner, in good condition, and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived.","4409":"When our third child, and first son was born, we sent our oldest to school (Kindergarten) with these for her friends to celebrate. It really made her feel important at school, and helped her celebrate the birth of our little boy. She loved doing it, and her friends enjoyed them too. BTW- teachers, we did clear it with the teachers at school first, so no hate mail please!","4410":"I have nothing but good service ever since I started ordering from amazon.com.  Keep up the good work.","4411":"DOP San Marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet... but I can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store. Is this unusual? Boston is pretty heavily Italian in some areas... maybe that makes a difference. i don't understand why anyone would buy them at this price. Check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price.","4412":"I discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes, they are worth paying for. Unfortunately in my area they are approaching 6 bucks a can and never go on sale. Walmart has them for about 4 dollars a can, but I prefer not to be tied down to that store. The local \"Italian mart\" advertised san marzano tomatoes, 4 cans for 5 dollars- too good to  be true? yes, in fact , these are very ordinary tomatoes. I am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good price.They turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience.","4413":"Purchased a small case of these tomatoes. I used them for Pizza Sauce and they tasted great. The labels looked identical to the picture posted on Amazon.","4414":"I love San Marzano tomatoes and Cento's are great. They have the greatest, sweetest taste ever. Worth ever penny and than some.","4415":"these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes.....full flavor, not too acidic and VERY italian!  Always the best choice for italian cooking....","4416":"most if not all of the cans were dented in some way, however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product","4417":"This is a fine product.  Why? Sure, it's has a flavor that on other tomato has, an earthy taste.","4418":"I have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product. I had a previous shipment where all was well, but not this time. The shipment came in a badly mangled box, but I thought all would be well when the interior box was pristine. I was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an undamaged box. This tells me that the can was already dented when packed. Amazon should reconsider their source for this product--the tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks.","4419":"The product is great ... but it is priced nearly twice what it retails for in local markets. I dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery, but this is too much","4420":"Good price for product... i had started my baby on the similac soy formula but it was too much for my son's tummy... this formula was a welcomed change.... unfortunately, it came at the funky time of similac's big recall of all the larger containers (i was buying the 34oz can from the wholesale store) and the smaller containers were all sold out of the local stores... not a fun situation... finding this 6-pack at a reasonable price was a much needed and appreciated rescue!","4421":"Great formula, our son is not getting stomach pains like with the regular Similac and he actually likes the taste.  The only thing is that it's way cheaper at Costco ($27.82 per 34oz + tax). Amazon is NOT willing to price match!!!","4422":"While I have not purchased this from Amazon I have used it for many years.  It makes a super layer for, my version, of Zuppa Engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for Pate Choux. I don't live in Hollywood any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to Amazon I find it it available and in larger cans.........  I plan to order soon.  Gino Rossi Mangia con passione chef\/caterer","4423":"Although I had some concerns about product with initial shipment - my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent, prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns.  Customer service that seems a rarity these days - was absolutely exceptional!  Will definitely keep this vendor in mind when I have need for other craft supplies\/products.","4424":"The M&M candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy. It does intimidate a M&M lover because of the small amount it dispenses.","4425":"I'm on my first jar of this, and am really enjoying what it adds to my \"concoctions\" - vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions, garlic, vegetables, usually tofu, rice or pasta or quinoa, sometimes olives or capers. I may have purchased it at Uwajimaya, when on sale...I will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste.  It's not really a paste - more liquid, with easily identifiable basil leaves.  I highly recommend this chili paste.","4426":"This deal on Amazon with the Prime free shipping, and\/or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do.  One of our favorites is layered graham crackers, this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping, and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting.  Lots of stores are discontinuing name brands, so this is a great item to buy here.","4427":"My husband LOVES pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner. This is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat. I love that I can add whatever I want to it to fancy it up a little. I love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids.","4428":"Like always this label is the best in desserts and this 3-4 ounce vanilla pudding is not the exeption, is easy to make, and vey fast, and the size is the best for a little families. The vanilla flavor is fantastic.","4429":"You can substitute nut milk, coconut milk or goat's milk or even soy milk for the 'milk' in this instant pudding.  If you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding! If you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding! You can add some softened cream cheese and have cheese cake base puddin'! You are only limited by your imagination. This is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix (about a 1\/3 packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid).","4430":"i always enjoy Jello pudding, however, one package that i recieved was opened, and the powder spilled all over.  it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24.","4431":"My big boy Oreo loves this so much. i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit ,turkey. He can't get enough of this stuff","4432":"Delivered by UPS, this product is just about perfect.  It does not have a disagreeable smell and the dogs love it.  It is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it.  You can even see an occasional pea and\/or carrot. No grain to worry about.","4433":"Bought 1\/2 lb each of five different Mo's Fudge recently from a school fundraiser. I'm not much of a chocolate fudge eater, prefer peanut butter, but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible. So rich and creamy! Almost too creamy. Had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut. But if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover, this can!","4434":"This mild semi-soft\/soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that I have yet to find elsewhere.  The price is worth it, though I can't afford to order it often, but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight!","4435":"This tea is absolutely incredible! Addicted after first taste. So delicious... the smell... the taste... it's a beautiful experience. I just ordered more (and gonna try both regular and decaf).","4436":"I love this tea and drink it at least twice a day.  The flavor is both strong and sweet.  The tea stands on it's own, never needing sweetner.  If you're a cinnamon lover, you have to try this tea.  And even if you're not, it's worth a try.","4437":"I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.","4438":"After having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition, I tried many different kinds and favors of tea until I stumbled  upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby. I loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years. The sachets are perfect for a larger mug, the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or mugs. It's a hearty tea that I find satisfying and delicious.","4439":"As a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor, I find this tea amazing.  I was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that.  I can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but I will continue to drink it probably every day.  Enjoy","4440":"Love this tea, its like drinking liquid red hots.  I hate herbal teas b\/c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome !!!!","4441":"A co-worker gave me a couple of the Harney & Sons Fine Teas Hot Cinnamon Spice Sachets to sample. The cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful. These teas are not available at my local grocery stores. I was glad to find them for a reasonable price on-line.","4442":"I love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste.  It's equally good as an iced tea.  Full marks!","4443":"I drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites. The scent is enticing and the flavor is bold, and sweet at the same time.  If you love spice, this is a must have tea.","4444":"Super tasty, super delicious. Best tea ever, sweet and cinnamony. I actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags.","4445":"This is an excellent tea, very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful, and overall it's slightly sweet without needing any sugar. Excellent with milk or straight.","4446":"This is more than just a tea, drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience. It has a multi-dimensional flavor, it really does. I never considered myself a tea drinker, but I ordered it once at a Starbucks and was hooked ever since. On special occasions or even when I am down, I treat myself to a cup of this warm and delicous tea.","4447":"It's that good!  Heaven if you like cinnamon.  Tastes sweet with no sugar.","4448":"I was actually surprised at how good these Muffins taste! I have reordered a case.  And they are Gluten Free.","4449":"Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had.","4450":"I love VitaMuffins, but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $6.29.  Instead I bought the mix, 3 boxes for $16.00, and each box makes 12 muffins. Instead of $1.62 per muffin, the mix only requires water & eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin, and very easy to make. That's a great deal.","4451":"I buy these through the ship-and-save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine. Light, flavorful, and full of vitamins, these only take 20-25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. I am vegan so I use egg substitutes  (3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 Tbs water) and they still bake perfectly.","4452":"better then I expected. I notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry. So I sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil.[same as pam butter spray]. This did the trick& they were great","4453":"I like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders.  These bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden.","4454":"My Scottish Terrier inhaled hers in about 2 hours, but my finicky Pomeranian, who usually turns his nose up at chew toys, loved it! It kept my Pom busy for a few weeks, but he really enjoyed it!  Affordable price, fast shopping, great product!","4455":"I love this frosting!  It's sugar free and I cannot find it in stores.  I will be ordering more in the future.","4456":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0002Z9BF8\">All Natural Dog Treats by Charlee Bear - Cheese & Egg - 16 oz resealable bag<\/a> These are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs. At only 4 calories per treat, even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too, especially in a multi-dog household where one dog is overweight, others are not. Taste must be wonderful since there isn't anything my dogs won't do for these tiny treats, so I'm very pleased with them for many reasons! GREAT PRODUCTS!!!","4457":"My dog's breeder sent home a baggie of cheese and egg flavored Charlie Bears for my Maltese puppy.  I used them to reward him from the get-go, and he will do just about anything if he knows this treat is coming.  A great training aid.  They are also small enough to give often, and are made with good ingredients.  I carry them in my pocket and my little guy keeps an eye on that pocket!","4458":"I love these treats for my two german shepherds. I think these treats are great for even large size dogs. My dogs absolutely go crazy for them, and they are only 3 calories per treat, perfect for training sessions. I also love the texture of them... you can put them in your pocket without a ton of flaking or gross smell. This product also has a simplified ingredient list... opposed to so many other dog treats out there. You can pronounce all the ingredients in the list and you know what they are getting.","4459":"I am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races.  This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.","4460":"Juice consentrate is very good. I like it as much as the Tart is Smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save. This will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on.\"","4461":"I have read a couple of the studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice, and became convinced that it's worth a try (as a 57-YO athlete).  I like this product b\/c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to, so I can make an informed choices as to how much I use, based on the number-of-cherry equivalents in the studies I've read.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the label, but I've no reason to doubt it.  I've grown to like the flavor, especially mixed with lime seltzer!","4462":"This juice is actually concentrated as advertised. Of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried, this one is the most concentrated, and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin. I guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general, but Montmorency RTCJ has the more tart best flavor!","4463":"Tastes like drinking a cherry pie. I purchased this for my mother's gout and she told me it works quickly. It's also supposed to help lower blood pressure. Speedy delivery. It's not 5 stars because of the high price.","4464":"Every bit as good as any other brand I've tried. Fantastic taste and easy to use. This stuff can become addictive.","4465":"Good, and reasonable for drink. A product that is good for sleeping and inflamation. I will buy again if the price stays reasonable.","4466":"This cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry :-)  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0032JKWGI\">Country Spoon Montmorency Red Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate 34 oz.<\/a> I like this product, and, perhaps, I will order this cherry juice concentrate again.","4467":"This is very good but I prefer the liquid cherry juice.  Less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesn't seem to go as far as the liquid juice.  Just my preference.","4468":"I have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out. I love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container. This makes them great to carry in my purse, take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc. Also love that they are not overly salted like so many American brand crackers. Company that shipped them did a great job - fast too!","4469":"This product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is. Takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag. Individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods.","4470":"If you like SweeTarts and you want them in a bulk amount, this product is for you. The SweeTarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition. There are no downsides.","4471":"Sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy.  While it's a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste.  You really can't go wrong with this candy.  The only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it you've eaten an entire roll.","4472":"I have ordered these a couple times now. They arrive super fresh and sealed every time. I used to buy a roll a day from the gas station, now I have a stash at home that is available anytime. Yumm","4473":"I've purchased bulk candies where they are old, terrible flavors, or simply smashed to dust. This was a great buy, having none of those drawbacks.","4474":"I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great, the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous, way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com","4475":"It is very very good sweets Amazon always is excellent Amazon always is excellent Amazon always is excellent Amazon always is excellent","4476":"Excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks Excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks Excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks","4477":"My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term \"Baci Pill\" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!","4478":"My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.

Outstanding price for such a rich product. The \"fortunes\" on the inside are an added bonus. Great options relating to packaging.","4481":"I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, fish, and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product.","4482":"Instead of Simple Solution Lamb & Rice I was sent Simple Lamb & Oatmeal but, my dog likes it. Next time I will make sure I am sent the right food. I didn't know until I had open and put the food in my 10lb container.","4483":"My Dogs love this natural kibble.  It's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty.  They maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements.  Wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog's diet and keep it out of their food.","4484":"I have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. The vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet.  I can't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. But simple is a good alternative, made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too.  Great product!!","4485":"Before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections. He ate grain free food, but he still got them. Both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean. I really recommend it.  While you can get it for $1 cheaper on other sites, you pay $18 for shipping.  I only wish Amazon had more than 3 bags of it each time!","4486":"quality food but the price is very high.  luv amazon's free ship over $25.","4487":"I was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough.  After ordering it, I got it two days later!  The directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal.  The toppings I added to my pizza were shrimp, chicken, cherry tomatoes, Mexican cheese blend, and turkey Canadian bacon.  The pizza turned out great! Only 8 Weight Watcher's Point Plus value per slice.  This is a better alternative to other leading pizzas.","4488":"My husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough. It was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone. We put Rossi Pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great!","4489":"Great stuff!Love that it's organic and raw. But later saw same thing @ TJ's for less than half the price!","4490":"I love this organic raw honey!  When using it in my tea I don't need a lot and the taste is great.  Honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it I also use it on my hair and face often. The darker the better.","4491":"I absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at Christmas and Valentine's Day. I would buy them all year if they were available: SO you can imagine how excited I was tao be able to get them for a while through Amazon.I can wait untill Christmas when they will be available again.","4492":"Cant find this flavor in the stores, so bought them here online.. Like them so much better than the Peppermint ones... I also like the Cinnamon Ones... Yum-O(as Rachel Ray states)...","4493":"The local merchants quit stocking this. Was pleased to buy this on line so I can make French Canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. All of Bob's Red Mill products are 5 star.","4494":"Its hard to find this stuff locally. Usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit. Was pleased to find it on Amazon.  Makes GREAT, TASTY dhall. We eat a lot of it, so its nice to know I can get it here again when I need it.","4495":"Bought these for a change from the green split peas. They are tasty and I like them. Will buy again. Always like Bob's Red Mill products.","4496":"Full bodied tea, no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated. Comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping. A great value for a good tea.","4497":"Together with many customers, I was frustrated when Tassimo and Starbucks ended their relationship. My coffee was Verona. Since that time, I have tried various alternatives (Gevalia Espresso, Tassimo Carte Noir, Tassimo Nabob & Kenco Med Roast) but with limited and varying degrees of success. After reading a previous review, I sent off for a supply to test it - I love it!!!!  I was on the point of giving my Tassimo machine away - no more.  A great start to the New Year.","4498":"I love this coffee, its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk. Its a big cup size 12oz so its great in the morning when I don't want to get up for coffee too much. If you have a Tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand!","4499":"it tastes pretty decent but I wasn't aware how pricy they were when I bought them.  I paid $17.44 for a pack of 12!!!
